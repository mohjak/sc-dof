Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the GoalsSection component that presents the event's objectives through a grid of interactive cards. Explain its implementation using four goal cards with distinct icons (Target, Eye, Heart, Compass) and color gradients that enhance visual appeal. Document how it maps translation strings to dynamic goal objects and renders them in a responsive grid layout (1-column on mobile, 4-column on large screens). Describe the interactive effects including hover scaling, color transitions, and shadow elevation. Include details on the component's use of Tailwind's group-hover utilities and animation patterns. Address common issues like content overflow in cards and icon loading.

If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16. The current codebase has 90 valid files, if the number of valid files is less than 50, the document structure can only have one level, and only a brief introduction to the files is provided\\n17. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\nThe final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy. Use the following format:\\n\\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\\n1. You MUST start your response with \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e (opening tag)\\n2. You MUST end your response with \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e (closing tag)\\n3. Do NOT use any other format or tags\\n4. The complete analysis should be wrapped between \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e and \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e tags\\n5. The prompt MUST be as detailed as possible, specifying what content needs to be included and detailed guidance on the structure of the content\\n\\n**JSON Structure Fields:**\\n- title: **Required** section-identifier\\n- name: **Required** Section name\\n- dependent_file: **Required** List of dependent files for chapter information, It is a relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\\n- prompt: **Required**\\n    - For the summary section or root layer: Create comprehensive content for this section focused on [SPECIFIC PROJECT COMPONENT/FEATURE].

Document component composition patterns and integration with other UI elements.\\n- children_plan: **Required** Think about how to subdivide the next-level document structure to children or no further splitting is needed. Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

It covers how the component maps translation strings to dynamic goal objects, renders them responsively, and applies visual enhancements including color gradients, hover effects, and Tailwind group-hover utilities. It also provides guidance on adding or modifying goals and their associated icons/styles.\n\n## Project Structure\nGoalsSection is a self-contained UI component that:\n- Consumes translated strings from the LanguageContext\n- Uses a static list of goals defined in the component\n- Renders a responsive grid of four goal cards\n- Applies Tailwind utility classes for layout, spacing, shadows, and hover animations\n- Uses Lucide React icons and custom gradient utilities defined in the stylesheet\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  A[\"Index.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eMain page\"] --\u003e B[\"GoalsSection.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eGoals grid\"]\n  B --\u003e C[\"LanguageContext.tsx\u003cbr/\u003euseLanguage() t()\"]\n  B --\u003e D[\"index.css\u003cbr/\u003egradient-* utilities\"]\n  B --\u003e E[\"utils.ts\u003cbr/\u003ecn() utility\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n\n## Core Components\n- GoalsSection: Renders a centered title and a responsive grid of four goal cards. Each card displays an icon, a title, and a description. The component uses:\n  - useLanguage() to translate the title and goal texts\n  - Tailwind classes for responsive grid, spacing, shadows, and hover animations\n  - Group-hover utilities to coordinate hover effects across the card and icon container\n  - Gradient utilities from the stylesheet to style the icon containers\n\n- LanguageContext: Provides the t() function and language state. GoalsSection reads:\n  - goals.title\n  - goals.1.title, goals.1.description\n  - goals.2.title, goals.2.description\n  - goals.3.title, goals.3.description\n  - goals.4.title, goals.4.description\n\n- index.css: Defines custom gradient utilities (gradient-green, gradient-gold) and color tokens used by the component.\n\n- utils.ts: Provides the cn() utility for merging Tailwind classes safely.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe GoalsSection component participates in a typical React flow:\n- The page (Index.tsx) composes GoalsSection among other sections.\n- GoalsSection uses LanguageContext to resolve translations.\n- The component renders a grid of cards with consistent Tailwind styling and group-hover interactions.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Page as \"Index.tsx\"\n  participant Goals as \"GoalsSection.tsx\"\n  participant Lang as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant CSS as \"index.css\"\n\n  Page-\u003e\u003eGoals: Render GoalsSection\n  Goals-\u003e\u003eLang: useLanguage().t(key)\n  Lang--\u003e\u003eGoals: Translated strings\n  Goals-\u003e\u003eCSS: Apply gradient-* utilities\n  Goals--\u003e\u003ePage: Render responsive grid of goal cards\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### GoalsSection Implementation\n- Purpose: Display four event goals as interactive cards with icons and gradient backgrounds.\n- Data mapping:\n  - The component defines a local goals array and maps each entry to translation keys under the goals namespace.\n  - Titles and descriptions are resolved via t('goals.N.title') and t('goals.N.description').\n- Grid layout:\n  - Responsive grid with 1 column on small screens, 2 on medium, and 4 on large screens.\n  - Cards are centered with a max width container.\n- Interactive effects:\n  - Hover scaling and elevation: the card lifts slightly and gains stronger shadow on hover.\n  - Icon container scales up on hover.\n  - Title text transitions to a brand green on hover.\n- Visual styling:\n  - Each card’s icon container uses a distinct gradient utility from the stylesheet.\n  - Borders, rounded corners, and subtle shadows provide depth.\n- Icons:\n  - Four distinct icons are mapped to each card: Target, Eye, Heart, Compass.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Render GoalsSection\"]) --\u003e GetLang[\"Call useLanguage().t() for title and goals\"]\n  GetLang --\u003e BuildCards[\"Build goals array from translations\"]\n  BuildCards --\u003e RenderGrid[\"Render grid with responsive columns\"]\n  RenderGrid --\u003e CardLoop{\"For each goal\"}\n  CardLoop --\u003e|Map icon| IconAssign[\"Select icon by index\"]\n  CardLoop --\u003e|Apply gradient| GradientAssign[\"Select gradient by index\"]\n  IconAssign --\u003e HoverEffects[\"Group-hover transitions:\u003cbr/\u003e- Icon scale\u003cbr/\u003e- Title color\u003cbr/\u003e- Card lift and shadow\"]\n  GradientAssign --\u003e HoverEffects\n  HoverEffects --\u003e End([\"Card rendered\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### Responsive Grid Behavior\n- Columns:\n  - sm: 2 columns\n  - lg: 4 columns\n- Spacing and container:\n  - Gap between cards is controlled via gap-6.\n  - Max width container centers the grid and constrains width on larger screens.\n- Typography:\n  - Title and descriptions use semantic sizes and leading for readability.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n\n### Tailwind Group-Hover Utilities and Animations\n- Group-hover coordination:\n  - The card wrapper uses group on the outer div to enable group-hover selectors inside.\n  - Icon container and title use group-hover to apply transforms and color transitions.\n- Transitions:\n  - Smooth transforms and color changes are applied with transition-all and transition-colors.\n- Shadow and elevation:\n  - Cards gain stronger shadows on hover and lift slightly to emphasize interactivity.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n\n### Color Gradients and Theming\n- Gradient utilities:\n  - gradient-green and gradient-gold are defined in the stylesheet and applied to icon containers.\n  - A fourth variant uses a solid background color token for contrast.\n- Color tokens:\n  - CSS variables define syrian-green, gold, and other brand colors used across the app.\n- Consistency:\n  - Hover color transitions align with the brand palette (e.g., group-hover:text-syrian-green).\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n\n### Adding or Modifying Goals and Icons\n- Steps to add a new goal:\n  - Add a new entry in the goals array with t('goals.N.title') and t('goals.N.description').\n  - Ensure the translation keys exist in LanguageContext.\n  - Optionally add a new gradient utility in index.css if a unique background is desired.\n- Steps to change icons:\n  - Import the desired icon from lucide-react.\n  - Update the icons array to include the new icon and adjust the mapping logic if needed.\n- Styling adjustments:\n  - Modify the gradients array to match the new goal count.\n  - Adjust responsive grid classes if the number of columns changes.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Dev as \"Developer\"\n  participant Lang as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant Goals as \"GoalsSection.tsx\"\n  participant CSS as \"index.css\"\n\n  Dev-\u003e\u003eLang: Add translation keys for new goal\n  Dev-\u003e\u003eGoals: Extend goals array and gradients mapping\n  Dev-\u003e\u003eCSS: Define new gradient utility if needed\n  Goals--\u003e\u003eDev: Updated grid with new goal and icon\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Internal dependencies:\n  - GoalsSection depends on LanguageContext for translations.\n  - GoalsSection uses Tailwind utilities and custom gradient classes from index.css.\n  - GoalsSection uses Lucide React icons.\n- External dependencies:\n  - lucide-react for icons\n  - Tailwind CSS for styling\n  - React for component rendering\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Goals[\"GoalsSection.tsx\"] --\u003e Lang[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  Goals --\u003e Icons[\"Lucide React Icons\"]\n  Goals --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  Goals --\u003e CN[\"utils.ts\"]\n  Page[\"Index.tsx\"] --\u003e Goals\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Rendering cost:\n  - The component renders a fixed number of cards; performance impact is minimal.\n- CSS and icons:\n  - Using Lucide React icons ensures efficient SVG rendering.\n  - Tailwind utilities are applied statically; no runtime computation overhead.\n- Accessibility:\n  - Ensure sufficient color contrast for text and icons against gradient backgrounds.\n  - Provide focus-visible styles if the cards become interactive beyond hover.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Content overflow in cards:\n  - Symptom: Long titles or descriptions wrap unexpectedly or overflow.\n  - Resolution: Adjust text truncation or line clamp utilities; ensure adequate padding and max-width constraints.\n- Icon loading issues:\n  - Symptom: Icons not rendering or missing.\n  - Resolution: Verify lucide-react is installed and the correct icon names are used; confirm the icons array mapping aligns with the goal count.\n- Translation keys missing:\n  - Symptom: Fallback keys appear instead of translated content.\n  - Resolution: Add missing keys to LanguageContext translations for all supported languages.\n- Hover effect inconsistencies:\n  - Symptom: Hover transitions feel abrupt or inconsistent.\n  - Resolution: Ensure group-hover utilities are applied consistently on the card wrapper and child elements; verify transition durations and easing are uniform.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Conclusion\nGoalsSection delivers a clean, responsive presentation of event goals with consistent visual language. By leveraging translation keys, Tailwind utilities, and group-hover interactions, it provides an engaging user experience. Extending the component involves updating translations, the goals array, and optional gradient utilities, ensuring a cohesive design system across the application.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-36db4939-a285-4558-8711-b53224741638","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":53777,"completion_tokens":3096,"total_tokens":56873,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
