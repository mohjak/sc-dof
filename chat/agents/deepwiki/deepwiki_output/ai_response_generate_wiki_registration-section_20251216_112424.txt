Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed documentation for the RegistrationSection component that facilitates user sign-up through QR code and direct link. Explain how it handles multilingual text rendering for title, subtitle, and button text using conditional logic based on the current language state from useLanguage. Document the visual design including the gradient background, decorative blur effects, and the prominent QR code generated using QRCodeSVG with custom styling (size 200, dark green foreground). Describe the registration card's decorative elements such as corner borders and glow effects, and explain the Button component's integration with an external link using asChild and proper accessibility attributes (target='_blank', rel='noopener'). Include the REGISTRATION_URL constant usage and security considerations for external navigation. Provide guidance on updating the registration URL and ensuring QR code readability across different devices.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nRegistration Section\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers:\n- Multilingual text rendering for title, subtitle, and button text using the current language state from the LanguageContext.\n- Visual design: gradient background, decorative blur effects, QR code card with glow and corner accents, and a prominent registration button.\n- Integration of the Button component with an external link using asChild and proper accessibility attributes.\n- The REGISTRATION_URL constant usage and security considerations for external navigation.\n- Guidance on updating the registration URL and ensuring QR code readability across devices.\n\n## Project Structure\nRegistrationSection is a self-contained UI component located under src/components. It relies on:\n- LanguageContext for language-aware text rendering.\n- shadcn/ui Button component for the external link button.\n- Tailwind CSS and custom theme tokens for styling and gradients.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  RS[\"RegistrationSection.tsx\"] --\u003e LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  RS --\u003e BTN[\"ui/button.tsx\"]\n  RS --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  RS --\u003e TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  APP[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e LC\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Core Components\n- RegistrationSection: Renders the registration section with QR code and a link to the registration form. It uses conditional logic to render multilingual text based on the current language state from useLanguage. It also renders decorative background blurs, a QR code card with glow and corner accents, and a styled button linking to the registration URL.\n- LanguageContext: Provides the language state and translation function (t) used by the app. RegistrationSection uses the language state to decide which language-specific text to display.\n- Button (shadcn/ui): A flexible button component that supports asChild to wrap an anchor tag for external links. RegistrationSection uses asChild to render an anchor inside the Button.\n- Tailwind theme: Defines custom colors and gradients, including the Syrian green palette used throughout the component.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n- RegistrationSection: orchestrates layout, styling, QR code rendering, and external link integration.\n- LanguageContext: supplies language-aware text and RTL state.\n- Button: renders accessible, themed links with asChild support.\n- Tailwind theme: provides consistent color tokens and gradients.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe RegistrationSection integrates with the internationalization system and UI primitives to deliver a localized, visually cohesive registration experience.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant RS as \"RegistrationSection\"\n  participant LC as \"LanguageContext\"\n  participant BTN as \"Button (asChild)\"\n  participant Browser as \"Browser\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eRS: View registration section\n  RS-\u003e\u003eLC: Read language and t()\n  LC--\u003e\u003eRS: language, t()\n  RS-\u003e\u003eRS: Compute title/subtitle/buttonText based on language\n  RS-\u003e\u003eRS: Render QR code and registration card\n  RS-\u003e\u003eBTN: Render Button with asChild\n  BTN-\u003e\u003eBrowser: Render anchor inside Button\n  User-\u003e\u003eBrowser: Click external link\n  Browser--\u003e\u003eUser: Open registration form in new tab\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Multilingual Text Rendering\nRegistrationSection reads the current language from useLanguage and computes:\n- Title text for the header and page heading.\n- Subtitle text with instructions to scan the QR code or click the link.\n- Button text for the external link.\n\nThe computed texts are rendered conditionally based on the language value. The component does not rely on the translation function (t) from the context; instead, it uses a language-aware conditional logic to pick the correct string for each language.\n\nAccessibility note: The computed text is used as aria-label or screen-reader-friendly text in the surrounding layout, ensuring assistive technologies announce the correct message.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L8-L28)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### Visual Design and Layout\n- Gradient background: A subtle diagonal gradient from a light Syrian green to the background color creates depth without competing with content.\n- Decorative blur effects: Two large blurred circles positioned at opposite corners add ambient visual interest.\n- Registration card: Centered card with rounded corners, a thin border, and soft shadow. The card contains:\n  - Corner accents: Four decorative borders at each corner to emphasize the card’s presence.\n  - Inner glow: A diffuse green glow behind the card to enhance depth.\n  - Decorative ring: A subtle border ring around the card for framing.\n- QR code: Embedded in a white, rounded, shadowed container. It is configured with a fixed size and high error correction level for robust scanning.\n\nStyling tokens:\n- The component uses the custom Syrian green palette defined in the Tailwind theme and CSS variables for consistent colors across the app.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L29-L78)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n### QR Code Rendering\nThe QR code is generated using QRCodeSVG with:\n- Fixed size for consistent scanning across devices.\n- High error correction level to improve robustness.\n- Foreground color matching the Syrian green palette.\n- White background for contrast.\n\nOptimization tip: Consider caching the QR code SVG or pre-rendering it as a static asset if the URL is static and performance is critical.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L64-L73)\n\n### External Link Button Integration\nRegistrationSection renders a Button component with asChild enabled. The Button wraps an anchor tag that:\n- Links to the REGISTRATION_URL constant.\n- Opens in a new tab with target=\"_blank\".\n- Uses rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" for security against reverse tabnabbing and window.opener exposure.\n\nThe Button is styled with a prominent green background, rounded pill shape, and hover effects including increased shadow and slight scaling.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant RS as \"RegistrationSection\"\n  participant BTN as \"Button (asChild)\"\n  participant Anchor as \"Anchor Element\"\n  participant Browser as \"Browser\"\n\n  RS-\u003e\u003eBTN: Render Button with asChild\n  BTN-\u003e\u003eAnchor: Render anchor inside Button\n  Anchor-\u003e\u003eBrowser: href points to REGISTRATION_URL\n  Anchor-\u003e\u003eBrowser: target=\"_blank\"\n  Anchor-\u003e\u003eBrowser: rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n  Browser--\u003e\u003eAnchor: Open link in new tab\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L97)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L97)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n### Security Considerations for External Navigation\n- Using rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" prevents the newly opened tab from accessing the original window and avoids potential phishing risks.\n- Opening links in a new tab keeps users on the current page while they complete registration.\n- Ensure the REGISTRATION_URL remains valid and monitored for changes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L88-L91)\n\n### Updating the Registration URL\nTo update the destination registration URL:\n- Change the REGISTRATION_URL constant to the new form link.\n- Verify QR code readability across devices after the change.\n- Test external link behavior in various browsers and devices.\n\nGuidance:\n- Keep the URL short and stable to minimize scanning errors.\n- Consider using a URL shortener if the original link is long, but ensure it resolves quickly and reliably.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L6-L6)\n\n### Ensuring QR Code Readability Across Devices\n- Maintain a fixed QR code size suitable for mobile scanning.\n- Use a high error correction level to handle partial damage or low-quality prints.\n- Ensure sufficient contrast between foreground and background colors.\n- Test scanning on multiple devices and lighting conditions.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L64-L73)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nRegistrationSection depends on:\n- LanguageContext for language-aware text rendering.\n- shadcn/ui Button for the external link button.\n- Tailwind theme for colors and gradients.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e RS[\"RegistrationSection.tsx\"]\n  BTN[\"ui/button.tsx\"] --\u003e RS\n  CSS[\"index.css\"] --\u003e RS\n  TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"] --\u003e RS\n  APP[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e LC\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- QR code rendering: QRCodeSVG generates a vector-based SVG. For static URLs, consider pre-rendering or caching to reduce runtime computation.\n- External link rendering: The Button component with asChild adds minimal overhead; ensure the anchor is lightweight and avoids heavy inline styles.\n- Theme tokens: Using CSS variables and Tailwind utilities keeps styles efficient and consistent.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Incorrect language text: Verify the language state in LanguageContext and ensure the conditional logic in RegistrationSection matches supported languages.\n- QR code not scanning: Increase error correction level, verify foreground/background contrast, and test on multiple devices.\n- External link opens in the same tab: Confirm asChild is enabled and the Button wraps an anchor with target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\".\n- Styling inconsistencies: Check that the Syrian green palette is defined in the Tailwind theme and CSS variables.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L8-L28)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L64-L73)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L97)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n## Conclusion\nRegistrationSection delivers a localized, visually engaging registration experience with a QR code and a secure external link. Its design leverages the Syrian green palette, decorative blur effects, and a prominent QR code card. By centralizing language-aware text rendering and using a robust Button component with proper security attributes, the component ensures accessibility and usability across languages and devices. Updating the registration URL and optimizing QR code readability are straightforward tasks that keep the component reliable and user-friendly.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-4013dae4-1ed6-4119-92d9-d0e89de3b2bc","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":30529,"completion_tokens":3242,"total_tokens":33771,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
