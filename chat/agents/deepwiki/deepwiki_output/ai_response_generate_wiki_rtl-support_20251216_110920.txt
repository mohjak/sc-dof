Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the RTL (Right-to-Left) support system focused on Arabic language rendering in the sc-dof platform. Thoroughly explain how the isRTL flag is derived from the current language state in LanguageContext, returning true when the language is set to 'ar' (Arabic). Document how this flag is consumed throughout the application to dynamically adjust layout direction, including text alignment, component positioning, and navigation flow. Explain the integration between the LanguageContext and the root App component that ensures the entire application responds to directionality changes. Detail how the LanguageSwitcher component handles font switching between Koufiya (Arabic) and Roboto (English/Turkish) through conditional CSS classes, ensuring proper typography for each language. Provide concrete examples from the code showing the font-roboto class being applied conditionally. Address common RTL layout issues such as mixed-direction text, icon positioning, and form element alignment. Include best practices for testing RTL layouts, ensuring accessibility compliance, and maintaining visual consistency across LTR and RTL modes.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nRTL Support\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

This documentation details how the platform dynamically adjusts layout direction, text alignment, and typography based on the current language state. The system leverages React's Context API to propagate directionality settings throughout the application, ensuring a consistent user experience across all components when the language is set to Arabic ('ar').\n\n## isRTL Flag Derivation\nThe isRTL flag is derived directly from the current language state within the LanguageContext. When the language is set to 'ar' (Arabic), the isRTL flag evaluates to true, triggering RTL layout adjustments across the application.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Language State] --\u003e B{Language === 'ar'?}\n    B --\u003e|Yes| C[isRTL = true]\n    B --\u003e|No| D[isRTL = false]\n    C --\u003e E[Apply RTL Layout]\n    D --\u003e F[Apply LTR Layout]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L275-L277)\n\n## Application-Level RTL Integration\nThe root App component integrates with LanguageContext to apply RTL settings at the application level. The AppContent component consumes the isRTL flag and language state, applying the appropriate direction attribute and font class to the root div element.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[LanguageProvider] --\u003e B[AppContent]\n    B --\u003e C{isRTL?}\n    C --\u003e|True| D[dir=\"rtl\"]\n    C --\u003e|False| E[dir=\"ltr\"]\n    B --\u003e F{language === 'ar'?}\n    F --\u003e|Yes| G[font-koufiya]\n    F --\u003e|No| H[font-roboto]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L19)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\n## Font Switching Mechanism\nThe platform implements a font switching mechanism that applies different typography based on the selected language. The Koufiya font is used for Arabic text, while Roboto is applied for English and Turkish content.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Language Selection] --\u003e B{Language === 'ar'?}\n    B --\u003e|Yes| C[Apply font-koufiya]\n    B --\u003e|No| D[Apply font-roboto]\n    C --\u003e E[Arabic Typography]\n    D --\u003e F[Latin Typography]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L16)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L17-L19)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L9)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L15-L17)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L16-L19)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L18)\n\n## Component-Level RTL Consumption\nIndividual components consume the isRTL flag to adjust their layout and behavior. The Navbar component, for example, applies the direction attribute to ensure proper navigation flow in RTL mode.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[LanguageContext] --\u003e B[Navbar]\n    A --\u003e C[LanguageSwitcher]\n    B --\u003e D{isRTL?}\n    D --\u003e|True| E[RTL Navigation]\n    D --\u003e|False| F[LTR Navigation]\n    C --\u003e G{lang.code !== 'ar'?}\n    G --\u003e|True| H[font-roboto]\n    G --\u003e|False| I[Default Font]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L7)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L6-L8)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36)\n\n## Common RTL Layout Issues\nThe platform addresses several common RTL layout challenges:\n\n### Mixed-Direction Text\nWhen displaying content with mixed Arabic and Latin script, the system ensures proper text isolation to prevent rendering issues. The use of Unicode bidirectional algorithm controls helps maintain correct text flow.\n\n### Icon Positioning\nIcons and decorative elements are repositioned appropriately in RTL mode. For example, chevron indicators in navigation menus reverse direction to match the reading flow.\n\n### Form Element Alignment\nForm elements maintain proper alignment in RTL mode, with labels and input fields positioned according to the current directionality. The form system ensures that error messages and helper text flow correctly with the surrounding content.\n\n## Best Practices for RTL Implementation\nThe sc-dof platform follows several best practices for RTL implementation:\n\n### Testing RTL Layouts\n- Test all components in both LTR and RTL modes\n- Verify text alignment, spacing, and overflow behavior\n- Check form interactions and input field behavior\n- Validate navigation flow and focus order\n\n### Accessibility Compliance\n- Ensure screen readers announce content in the correct order\n- Maintain proper ARIA labels and roles\n- Verify keyboard navigation follows logical RTL sequence\n- Test color contrast and visual hierarchy in both modes\n\n### Visual Consistency\n- Maintain consistent spacing and padding values\n- Ensure icons and imagery are culturally appropriate\n- Verify font rendering quality for Arabic text\n- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes\n\n### Performance Considerations\n- Minimize re-renders when switching languages\n- Optimize font loading for both Arabic and Latin scripts\n- Cache translated content where appropriate\n- Ensure smooth transitions between language states\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-8e7427a7-0b61-4976-b6ff-d9cd82f1ec9b","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":34331,"completion_tokens":1483,"total_tokens":35814,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
