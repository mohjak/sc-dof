Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate API documentation for the Form component built on React Hook Form and Zod validation. Document its composition with FormField, FormItem, FormLabel, FormControl, FormMessage. Explain how it integrates with the application's validation strategy and error handling. Provide usage examples from potential registration or contact forms. Detail accessibility features like automatic labeling, error messaging with aria-invalid, and focus management on submission. Include configuration options for default values, revalidation modes, and async validation. Address common issues such as uncontrolled input state mismatches and provide solutions.

It provides a structured, accessible, and type-safe approach to form management in the application. The component system enables efficient form state management, validation, and error handling while maintaining high performance through uncontrolled components and optimized re-renders.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L129)\n\n## Core Components\nThe Form component system consists of several interconnected components that work together to create a cohesive form experience:\n\n- **Form**: A wrapper around React Hook Form's FormProvider that manages form state and validation\n- **FormField**: A context provider that connects individual form fields to the form state\n- **FormItem**: A container component that groups form elements and provides unique IDs\n- **FormLabel**: A label component that automatically associates with form controls\n- **FormControl**: A slot component that wraps the actual input element\n- **FormDescription**: A helper text component for additional field information\n- **FormMessage**: A component that displays validation error messages\n\nThese components work together to create a consistent, accessible form experience throughout the application.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L129)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe Form component architecture is built on React Hook Form's uncontrolled component pattern, which provides performance benefits by minimizing re-renders and avoiding the overhead of controlled components. The component tree uses React Context to pass form state and field information down to individual components.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    Form[Form Component] --\u003e FormProvider[React Hook Form Provider]\n    Form --\u003e FormField[FormField]\n    FormField --\u003e FormItem[FormItem]\n    FormItem --\u003e FormLabel[FormLabel]\n    FormItem --\u003e FormControl[FormControl]\n    FormItem --\u003e FormDescription[FormDescription]\n    FormItem --\u003e FormMessage[FormMessage]\n    FormProvider --\u003e useFormContext[useFormContext Hook]\n    FormField --\u003e FormFieldContext[FormFieldContext]\n    FormItem --\u003e FormItemContext[FormItemContext]\n    FormControl --\u003e useFormField[useFormField Hook]\n    FormMessage --\u003e useFormField\n    FormLabel --\u003e useFormField\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L129)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L129)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Form Component\nThe Form component is a simple wrapper around React Hook Form's FormProvider, providing a clean API for form state management.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Form {\n        +FormProvider: React Component\n    }\n    \n    Form --\u003e FormProvider : \"wraps\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L9)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L9)\n\n### FormField Component\nThe FormField component uses React Hook Form's Controller to connect individual form fields to the form state. It provides a context that contains the field name, enabling other components to access field-specific information.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class FormField {\n        +name: string\n        +render: function\n        +control: Control\n    }\n    \n    FormField --\u003e Controller : \"uses\"\n    FormField --\u003e FormFieldContext : \"provides\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L20-L31)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L20-L31)\n\n### FormItem Component\nThe FormItem component serves as a container for form elements, providing a consistent layout and generating unique IDs for accessibility purposes.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class FormItem {\n        +id: string\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    FormItem --\u003e FormItemContext : \"provides\"\n    FormItem --\u003e div : \"renders\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L62-L73)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L62-L73)\n\n### FormLabel Component\nThe FormLabel component automatically associates with its corresponding form control using the htmlFor attribute. It also applies error styling when the field is invalid.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class FormLabel {\n        +className: string\n        +htmlFor: string\n    }\n    \n    FormLabel --\u003e Label : \"extends\"\n    FormLabel --\u003e useFormField : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L75-L83)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L75-L83)\n\n### FormControl Component\nThe FormControl component wraps the actual input element and applies accessibility attributes based on the field's validation state.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class FormControl {\n        +id: string\n        +aria-describedby: string\n        +aria-invalid: boolean\n    }\n    \n    FormControl --\u003e Slot : \"extends\"\n    FormControl --\u003e useFormField : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L85-L100)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L85-L100)\n\n### FormMessage Component\nThe FormMessage component displays validation error messages when a field is invalid. It automatically hides when there are no errors.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class FormMessage {\n        +className: string\n        +children: ReactNode\n        +id: string\n    }\n    \n    FormMessage --\u003e p : \"renders\"\n    FormMessage --\u003e useFormField : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L111-L127)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L111-L127)\n\n## Validation Strategy and Error Handling\nThe Form component integrates with React Hook Form's validation system, which supports both synchronous and asynchronous validation. The application uses Zod for schema validation, as evidenced by its presence in the package.json dependencies.\n\nWhen a field is invalid, the FormMessage component automatically displays the error message. The error state is propagated through the useFormField hook, which provides access to the field's error object. The FormLabel and FormControl components also respond to error states by applying appropriate styling and accessibility attributes.\n\nThe validation strategy follows React Hook Form's default behavior of validating on blur, but this can be configured through the form's configuration options.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L33-L54)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L63)\n\n## Accessibility Features\nThe Form component system includes several accessibility features:\n\n- **Automatic labeling**: The FormLabel component automatically associates with its corresponding form control using the htmlFor attribute\n- **Error messaging**: The FormMessage component provides clear error messages when validation fails\n- **ARIA attributes**: The FormControl component applies aria-invalid and aria-describedby attributes based on the field's validation state\n- **Focus management**: The component system works with React Hook Form's focus management to ensure proper focus behavior\n- **Unique IDs**: The FormItem component generates unique IDs for each form element, ensuring proper accessibility\n\nThese features ensure that forms are accessible to users of assistive technologies and comply with WCAG guidelines.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L85-L95)\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L75-L82)\n\n## Configuration Options\nThe Form component supports various configuration options through React Hook Form's useForm hook. These include:\n\n- **Default values**: Initial values for form fields\n- **Revalidation modes**: Configuration for when form fields should be revalidated\n- **Async validation**: Support for asynchronous validation functions\n- **Error handling**: Custom error messages and validation rules\n\nThese options can be passed to the useForm hook when creating a form, allowing for flexible configuration based on the specific use case.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L4)\n\n## Usage Examples\nWhile specific form implementations are not present in the codebase, the Form component can be used to create various types of forms, such as registration forms and contact forms. The component system provides a consistent API for creating accessible, validated forms throughout the application.\n\nFor a registration form, the component would be used as follows:\n- Form to wrap the entire form\n- FormField for each input field (name, email, password, etc.)\n- FormItem to group each field's components\n- FormLabel for field labels\n- FormControl to wrap input elements\n- FormMessage to display validation errors\n\nSimilarly, for a contact form, the same component structure would be used with appropriate fields (name, email, message, etc.).\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L129)\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions\n\n### Uncontrolled Input State Mismatches\nA common issue with uncontrolled components is state mismatches when default values change after the form is initialized. This can be resolved by using the key prop to force a component re-mount when default values change, or by using React Hook Form's reset function to update the form state.\n\n### Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components\nThe Form component uses uncontrolled components for performance reasons, but this can lead to confusion when developers expect controlled behavior. The solution is to use React Hook Form's register function or Controller component to properly connect inputs to the form state.\n\n### Validation Timing\nThe default validation behavior (on blur) may not meet all requirements. This can be configured by passing validationMode options to the useForm hook, allowing validation on change, submit, or other events.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L4)\n\n## Performance Characteristics\nThe Form component system provides several performance benefits:\n\n- **Uncontrolled components**: By using uncontrolled components, the form avoids the overhead of React state updates for every input change, resulting in better performance for large forms\n- **Efficient re-renders**: React Hook Form only re-renders components that need to be updated, minimizing unnecessary re-renders\n- **Optimized validation**: Validation is performed efficiently, with options to debounce or throttle validation for better performance\n- **Lightweight**: The component system is built on lightweight primitives, avoiding unnecessary wrappers or complexity\n\nThese performance characteristics make the Form component suitable for complex forms with many fields, ensuring a smooth user experience.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L4)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L55)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-11812938-6800-45e7-b4ca-19abdc55185f","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":31273,"completion_tokens":2532,"total_tokens":33805,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
