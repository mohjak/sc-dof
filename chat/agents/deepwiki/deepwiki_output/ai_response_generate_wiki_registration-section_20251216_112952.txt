Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the RegistrationSection component that facilitates event sign-up through both QR code and direct link. Explain its implementation with a centered layout, decorative background blurs, and a prominent QR code generated using qrcode.react. Document how it handles multilingual display of title, subtitle, and button text through language-specific conditional rendering. Describe the visual design elements including the custom-styled button with hover effects, scale transformation, and shadow elevation, as well as the QR code card with corner decorations and glow effects. Include details on the external link integration with proper security attributes (noopener noreferrer). Address common issues like QR code scanning reliability and responsive layout on different devices.

It covers the centered layout, decorative background blurs, prominent QR code rendering, multilingual text handling, and the custom-styled button with hover effects and shadow elevation. It also addresses external link security, responsive behavior, QR scanning reliability, and guidance for updating the registration URL and customizing colors and styles.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe RegistrationSection is part of the components library and integrates into the main page layout. It relies on the LanguageContext for multilingual rendering and Tailwind CSS for styling. The QR code is rendered using the qrcode.react library.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\"]\n    IndexPage[\"Index.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Components\"\n    RegSec[\"RegistrationSection.tsx\"]\n    LangSwitch[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n    Btn[\"ui/button.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Contexts\"\n    LangCtx[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Styling\"\n    CSS[\"index.css\"]\n    TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Dependencies\"\n    QR[\"qrcode.react (package.json)\"]\n  end\n\n  App --\u003e IndexPage\n  IndexPage --\u003e RegSec\n  RegSec --\u003e LangCtx\n  RegSec --\u003e Btn\n  RegSec --\u003e QR\n  App --\u003e LangCtx\n  LangCtx --\u003e LangSwitch\n  CSS --\u003e TW\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L200)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Core Components\n- RegistrationSection: Renders multilingual header, subtitle, QR code, and a prominent button linking to the registration URL. It uses decorative background blurs and a QR code card with corner decorations and a glow effect.\n- LanguageContext: Provides language state and translation keys, enabling conditional rendering of localized text.\n- LanguageSwitcher: Allows users to change language, which updates the RegistrationSection’s text.\n- Button (ui): A reusable button component used for the external registration link.\n- Styling: Uses Tailwind CSS with custom syrian-green palette and gradients.\n\nKey implementation highlights:\n- Multilingual rendering via conditional logic based on the current language.\n- QR code rendering with qrcode.react and custom styling.\n- External link with proper security attributes.\n- Responsive layout using container and max-width utilities.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe RegistrationSection depends on the LanguageContext for language-aware text and on the Button component for the external link. The QR code is rendered via qrcode.react. Styling is driven by Tailwind CSS with custom color tokens.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Page as \"Index.tsx\"\n  participant Reg as \"RegistrationSection.tsx\"\n  participant Ctx as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant Btn as \"ui/button.tsx\"\n  participant QR as \"qrcode.react\"\n  participant Browser as \"Browser\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003ePage: Navigate to page\n  Page-\u003e\u003eReg: Render component\n  Reg-\u003e\u003eCtx: useLanguage()\n  Ctx--\u003e\u003eReg: {language, t}\n  Reg-\u003e\u003eReg: Compute title/subtitle/buttonText based on language\n  Reg-\u003e\u003eQR: Render QRCodeSVG(value=REGISTRATION_URL)\n  Reg-\u003e\u003eBtn: Render Button(asChild) with anchor\n  Btn-\u003e\u003eBrowser: Open external link with rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n  Browser--\u003e\u003eUser: Registration form\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L200)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### RegistrationSection Implementation\n- Layout and Background:\n  - Centered content with a max width container and text centering.\n  - Decorative blurred circles positioned absolutely to create a soft background glow.\n  - Gradient background blending subtle green hues with the base theme.\n- Header and Text:\n  - Inline header with an icon and localized title.\n  - H2 title and paragraph subtitle, both localized based on the current language.\n- QR Code Card:\n  - A floating glow effect behind the card using a blurred div.\n  - A bordered card with rounded corners and inner shadow.\n  - Corner decorations implemented with border overlays.\n  - QR code inside a white padded container with a dark green foreground and white background.\n- Button:\n  - Large custom-styled button using the ui/Button component.\n  - Hover effects: reduced opacity, increased shadow, and slight scale-up.\n  - External link with target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\".\n- Multilingual Rendering:\n  - Conditional logic selects the appropriate text for title, subtitle, and button text based on the current language.\n- QR Code Generation:\n  - Uses QRCodeSVG from qrcode.react with a fixed size and high error correction level.\n- External Link Security:\n  - Proper use of target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" for safe external navigation.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Render RegistrationSection\"]) --\u003e GetLang[\"Get language from LanguageContext\"]\n  GetLang --\u003e ComputeText[\"Compute title/subtitle/buttonText\"]\n  ComputeText --\u003e RenderHeader[\"Render localized header and h2\"]\n  RenderHeader --\u003e RenderSubtitle[\"Render localized subtitle\"]\n  RenderSubtitle --\u003e RenderCard[\"Render QR code card with glow and corners\"]\n  RenderCard --\u003e RenderQR[\"Render QRCodeSVG with REGISTRATION_URL\"]\n  RenderQR --\u003e RenderButton[\"Render Button with external link\"]\n  RenderButton --\u003e End([\"Done\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n### Multilingual Display and Language Context\n- LanguageContext provides:\n  - language state and setLanguage function.\n  - t function for translation keys.\n  - isRTL flag for directionality.\n- RegistrationSection uses the language state to compute localized strings for title, subtitle, and button text.\n- LanguageSwitcher toggles language among Arabic, English, and Turkish, reflecting the supported languages.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class LanguageContext {\n    +language\n    +setLanguage(lang)\n    +t(key) string\n    +isRTL bool\n  }\n\n  class RegistrationSection {\n    +renders localized title/subtitle/buttonText\n    +uses QRCodeSVG\n    +opens external link\n  }\n\n  class LanguageSwitcher {\n    +switches language\n  }\n\n  RegistrationSection --\u003e LanguageContext : \"useLanguage()\"\n  LanguageSwitcher --\u003e LanguageContext : \"setLanguage()\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n### Visual Design Elements\n- Colors and Palette:\n  - Custom syrian-green palette defined in CSS variables and exposed via Tailwind.\n  - Used for text, borders, glows, and button backgrounds.\n- Typography:\n  - Font selection switches between Arabic and Latin scripts based on language.\n- Button Styling:\n  - Large rounded button with hover-scale and enhanced shadow.\n  - Uses the ui/Button component with asChild to render an anchor element.\n- QR Code Card:\n  - Glowing background blur behind the card.\n  - Decorative borders at each corner.\n  - Inner white padding and shadow for contrast.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n### External Link Integration and Security\n- The button opens the registration URL in a new tab with rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" for security.\n- The link is implemented using the ui/Button component with asChild to render an anchor element.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L97)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Internal Dependencies:\n  - RegistrationSection depends on LanguageContext for localization.\n  - Uses ui/Button for the external link.\n  - Renders QR code via qrcode.react.\n- External Dependencies:\n  - qrcode.react is declared in package.json.\n- Styling Dependencies:\n  - Tailwind CSS with custom syrian-green color tokens.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Reg[\"RegistrationSection.tsx\"] --\u003e LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  Reg --\u003e BTN[\"ui/button.tsx\"]\n  Reg --\u003e QR[\"qrcode.react\"]\n  LC --\u003e LS[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  CSS[\"index.css\"] --\u003e TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L200)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L200)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- QR Code Rendering:\n  - QRCodeSVG renders a static image; performance impact is minimal.\n  - Consider caching the QR code image server-side if frequently reused across sessions.\n- External Link Navigation:\n  - Opening in a new tab avoids blocking the current page.\n- Styling:\n  -
