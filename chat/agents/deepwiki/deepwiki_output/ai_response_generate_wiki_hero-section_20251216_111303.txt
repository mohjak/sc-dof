Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the HeroSection component that serves as the primary landing experience for the event website. Explain its implementation using a full-viewport layout with background imagery, gradient overlays, and decorative confetti animation. Document how it integrates the CountdownTimer component and displays multilingual content through the t() translation function. Describe the responsive design techniques using Tailwind CSS for text scaling and layout adjustments across breakpoints. Include examples of the component's animation patterns (fade-up, float) and visual effects (drop-shadow, backdrop-blur). Address common issues like background image optimization, accessibility for screen readers, and performance considerations for animations. Provide guidance on customizing the hero content, images, and styling for future events.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nHero Section\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

[Customization Guidelines](#customization-guidelines)\n\n## Introduction\nThe HeroSection component serves as the primary landing experience for the event website, creating an immersive full-viewport introduction that captures the significance of Liberation Day. This component combines visual storytelling with interactive elements to engage visitors immediately upon arrival. It features a full-screen background image with gradient overlays, decorative confetti animations, and integrates the CountdownTimer component to build anticipation for the upcoming event. The design incorporates Syrian national symbols including the Syrian eagle emblem and flag, creating a culturally resonant experience. Built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, the component demonstrates a sophisticated implementation of modern web design principles including responsive layouts, smooth animations, and multilingual support.\n\n## Core Implementation\n\nThe HeroSection is implemented as a React functional component that creates a full-viewport experience with layered visual elements. The component structure follows a z-index hierarchy to manage overlapping elements, with the background image at the lowest level, followed by gradient overlays, decorative elements, and content in the foreground. The component uses the `min-h-screen` class to ensure full viewport height and `flex items-center justify-center` for perfect vertical and horizontal centering of content. It imports three key assets: the main hero image (`hero-celebration.jpg`), the Syrian eagle emblem, and the Syrian flag. The component integrates the CountdownTimer as a child component, positioning it prominently within the content flow. The section is assigned an ID of \"hero\" to enable programmatic navigation from other parts of the application. The implementation leverages React's component composition pattern, breaking down complex UI into reusable pieces while maintaining a cohesive visual experience.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L6-L97)\n\n## Visual Design and Styling\n\nThe visual design of the HeroSection employs a sophisticated layering technique to create depth and visual interest. The background consists of a full-coverage image with a semi-transparent gradient overlay that runs from top to bottom, darkening the image appropriately to ensure text readability. The gradient uses variable opacity levels (60%, 40%, and 80%) to create a dynamic effect that accommodates different content sections. The component utilizes custom CSS variables defined in the `:root` declaration for consistent theming, including specific colors for the Syrian flag (red, green, black) and gold accents. Tailwind's `backdrop-blur-sm` class is applied to the tagline container, creating a frosted glass effect that enhances text legibility against the busy background. The Syrian eagle emblem features a `drop-shadow-2xl` effect for dramatic depth, while the flag image includes a subtle border and shadow for a lifted appearance. The CTA button uses a custom `gradient-gold` class with a glowing effect (`glow-gold`) on hover, creating an interactive focal point.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[HeroSection] --\u003e B[Background Image]\n    A --\u003e C[Gradient Overlay]\n    A --\u003e D[Confetti Animation]\n    A --\u003e E[Content Container]\n    E --\u003e F[Syrian Eagle Emblem]\n    E --\u003e G[Main Title]\n    E --\u003e H[Subtitle]\n    E --\u003e I[Tagline with Backdrop Blur]\n    E --\u003e J[Syrian Flag]\n    E --\u003e K[CountdownTimer]\n    E --\u003e L[Date Badge]\n    E --\u003e M[CTA Button]\n    B --\u003e|Overlay| C\n    D --\u003e|Decorative| A\n    E --\u003e|Z-index| 10\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L10-L97)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L60-L72)\n\n## Animation System\n\nThe HeroSection implements a comprehensive animation system that enhances user engagement through subtle, purposeful motion. The component features multiple animation patterns that work in concert to create a dynamic yet not overwhelming experience. The primary animation pattern is the \"fade-up\" effect, applied to all content elements with staggered delays (100ms increments) to create a cascading appearance effect. The Syrian eagle emblem features a continuous floating animation (`animate-float`) that gently moves the element up and down over a 3-second cycle, creating a sense of lightness and celebration. The background includes a decorative confetti animation with 15 randomly positioned elements that fall at different speeds and angles, each with random delays and durations. These confetti pieces use the Syrian national colors (red, green, and gold) to maintain thematic consistency. The animations are defined in CSS using keyframes and applied through utility classes, with the `forwards` property ensuring elements remain in their final state after animation completion. The CTA button includes a hover animation (`hover:scale-105`) that provides tactile feedback, enhancing the interactive experience.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    Start([Animation System]) --\u003e FadeUp[\"Fade-up Animation\"]\n    FadeUp --\u003e|Class| animate-fade-up\n    FadeUp --\u003e|Duration| 0.6s\n    FadeUp --\u003e|Easing| ease-out\n    FadeUp --\u003e|Fill| forwards\n    \n    Start --\u003e Float[\"Float Animation\"]\n    Float --\u003e|Class| animate-float\n    Float --\u003e|Duration| 3s\n    Float --\u003e|Timing| ease-in-out\n    Float --\u003e|Iteration| infinite\n    Float --\u003e|Transform| translateY(-10px)\n    \n    Start --\u003e Confetti[\"Confetti Animation\"]\n    Confetti --\u003e|Class| animate-confetti\n    Confetti --\u003e|Duration| 4-8s\n    Confetti --\u003e|Timing| linear\n    Confetti --\u003e|Iteration| infinite\n    Confetti --\u003e|Transform| translateY(100vh) rotate(720deg)\n    \n    Start --\u003e Stagger[\"Stagger Delays\"]\n    Stagger --\u003e delay-100[\"delay-100: 100ms\"]\n    Stagger --\u003e delay-200[\"delay-200: 200ms\"]\n    Stagger --\u003e delay-300[\"delay-300: 300ms\"]\n    Stagger --\u003e delay-400[\"delay-400: 400ms\"]\n    Stagger --\u003e delay-500[\"delay-500: 500ms\"]\n    \n    Start --\u003e Hover[\"Hover Animations\"]\n    Hover --\u003e CTA[\"CTA Button: hover:scale-105\"]\n    Hover --\u003e Duration[\"Duration: 300ms\"]\n    \n    style Start fill:#f9f,stroke:#333\n    style animate-fade-up fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n    style animate-float fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n    style animate-confetti fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L38-L84)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L175-L248)\n\n## Internationalization Support\n\nThe HeroSection component fully supports multilingual content through the translation function `t()` provided by the LanguageContext. The component accesses the translation system via the `useLanguage()` hook, which returns both the current language setting and the translation function. All visible text content in the HeroSection is rendered through translation keys rather than hardcoded strings, enabling seamless language switching. The component displays different content based on the selected language (Arabic, English, or Turkish), with appropriate text direction handling (RTL for Arabic). The translation system is implemented as a nested object structure with language codes as top-level keys and dot-separated path keys for specific content elements. The `t()` function includes fallback behavior, returning the key itself if a translation is missing. The CountdownTimer component also supports internationalization, with time unit labels (Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds) translated according to the current language setting. The system automatically applies the appropriate font family based on language, using Bahij Koufiya for Arabic and Roboto for English and Turkish, ensuring optimal text rendering for each language.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class LanguageContext {\n        +language: Language\n        +setLanguage(lang: Language)\n        +t(key: string): string\n        +isRTL: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class HeroSection {\n        +t: (key: string) =\u003e string\n        +language: Language\n        +isRTL: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class CountdownTimer {\n        +language: Language\n        +labels: Record~Language, Record~string, string~~\n        +currentLabels: Record~string, string~\n    }\n    \n    class Translations {\n        +ar: Record~string, string~\n        +en: Record~string, string~\n        +tr: Record~string, string~\n    }\n    \n    HeroSection --\u003e LanguageContext : \"uses\"\n    CountdownTimer --\u003e LanguageContext : \"uses\"\n    LanguageContext --\u003e Translations : \"contains\"\n    \n    note right of HeroSection\n        Uses translation keys:\n        - hero.title\n        - hero.subtitle\n        - hero.tagline\n        - hero.discoverMore\n        - hero.date\n        - hero.day\n        - event.time\n    end note\n    \n    note right of CountdownTimer\n        Uses language-specific labels:\n        - days, hours, minutes, seconds\n        in Arabic, English, and Turkish\n    end note\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L7-L8)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L264)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L40-L46)\n\n## Responsive Design\n\nThe HeroSection implements a comprehensive responsive design strategy using Tailwind CSS's breakpoint system to ensure optimal viewing across all device sizes. The component uses relative units and flexible layouts to adapt to different screen dimensions, with specific adjustments at key breakpoints (sm: 640px, md: 768px, lg: 1024px). Text elements scale appropriately with viewport size, using classes like `text-4xl sm:text-6xl md:text-7xl` for the main title to ensure readability on both mobile and desktop devices. The content container uses `max-w-5xl mx-auto` to constrain width on larger screens while remaining full-width on smaller devices. Image dimensions are responsive, with the Syrian eagle emblem scaling from `w-24 h-24` on mobile to `w-32 h-32` on larger screens. The layout maintains its vertical centering and visual hierarchy across all breakpoints, with appropriate spacing adjustments using Tailwind's margin and padding utilities. The component also respects the global font family selection based on language, ensuring proper text rendering and layout for both RTL and LTR languages. The responsive design prioritizes content legibility and visual impact on all devices, with careful consideration given to touch target sizes and interaction patterns on mobile devices.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L47-L88)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L7-L97)\n\n## Accessibility and Performance\n\nThe HeroSection component addresses key accessibility and performance considerations to ensure an inclusive and efficient user experience. For accessibility, the component includes appropriate alt text for all decorative images, with the Syrian eagle having the Arabic description \"العقاب السوري\" and the flag described as \"علم سوريا الحرة\". The full-viewport layout is implemented with proper semantic HTML using the `\u003csection\u003e` element with an ID for programmatic navigation. The animations are designed with user comfort in mind, using moderate durations and easing functions to avoid triggering vestibular disorders. The component avoids auto-playing audio or video that could be distracting for users with attention disorders. For performance, the background image optimization is critical, though specific optimization techniques are not visible in the code. The confetti animation uses CSS transforms and opacity changes rather than layout or paint-intensive properties for smooth 60fps performance. The CountdownTimer component efficiently updates only once per second using setInterval, with proper cleanup in the useEffect cleanup function to prevent memory leaks. The component minimizes re-renders by using stable references and avoiding inline function definitions in the render method. The use of Tailwind's JIT compiler ensures only used utility classes are included in the final CSS bundle, reducing payload size.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L40-L43)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L32-L38)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L175-L248)\n\n## Customization Guidelines\n\nCustomizing the HeroSection for future events requires modifications to several key areas while maintaining the overall design system. To update the event content, modify the translation strings in the LanguageContext for the hero section keys (hero.title, hero.subtitle, etc.) and update the eventData.ts file with new dates and details. For visual customization, replace the hero image, Syrian eagle, and flag assets with new images while maintaining similar dimensions for consistent layout. The color scheme can be adjusted by modifying the CSS variables in index.css, particularly the --syrian-red, --syrian-green, and --gold variables, which will automatically propagate to all components using these colors. Animation parameters can be customized by editing the keyframe definitions in index.css, such as adjusting the float amplitude or confetti fall speed. The responsive behavior can be fine-tuned by adjusting the Tailwind classes on text elements and containers. When adding new elements, follow the existing animation sequence by using the staggered delay classes (delay-100, delay-200, etc.) to maintain the cascading entrance effect. Ensure any new images are optimized for web delivery to maintain performance, and verify that all interactive elements maintain sufficient contrast ratios for accessibility compliance.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L97)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L60-L72)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L264)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-7c7ca5c0-3a6b-4dc0-aaf9-47c8c46d45ad","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":29487,"completion_tokens":3241,"total_tokens":32728,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
