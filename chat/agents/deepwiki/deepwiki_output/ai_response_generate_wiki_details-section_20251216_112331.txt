Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the DetailsSection component that displays essential event information (date, time, location) through three interactive cards. Explain its implementation with a green background theme, decorative Syrian flag watermark, and responsive grid layout. Document how each card uses Lucide React icons (Calendar, Clock, MapPin) and displays translated content via the t() function. Describe the location card's integration with Google Maps through an external link and its visual treatment with hover effects. Include details on accessibility features like proper link semantics and responsive text sizing. Address common issues like external link handling and ensuring the map link opens correctly on mobile devices.

[Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n## Introduction\nThis document explains the DetailsSection component that presents essential event information through three interactive cards: Date, Time, and Location. It covers the green-themed background, decorative Syrian flag watermark, responsive grid layout, Lucide React icons, translated content via the t() function, and the Location card’s integration with Google Maps through an external link. Accessibility features, responsive text sizing, and common issues such as external link handling on mobile devices are addressed. Guidance is included for updating event details and customizing the color scheme.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe DetailsSection is implemented as a standalone component that relies on:\n- Translation context for localized text\n- Tailwind CSS for theming and responsive layout\n- Lucide React icons for visual cues\n- A decorative watermark image positioned absolutely behind the content\n- A responsive grid layout using Tailwind’s grid utilities\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  DS[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"] --\u003e LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\u003cbr/\u003et() function\"]\n  DS --\u003e ICONS[\"Lucide Icons\u003cbr/\u003eCalendar, Clock, MapPin\"]\n  DS --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\u003cbr/\u003eCustom colors and utilities\"]\n  DS --\u003e TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\u003cbr/\u003eExtended colors and fonts\"]\n  DS --\u003e MAP[\"External Link\u003cbr/\u003eGoogle Maps URL\"]\n  DS --\u003e GRID[\"Responsive Grid\u003cbr/\u003eTailwind grid-cols-*\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Core Components\n- DetailsSection: Renders three cards with icons and translated content, applies a green background theme, and overlays a decorative Syrian flag watermark. The Location card is implemented as an anchor element linking to Google Maps.\n- LanguageContext: Provides the t() function for translations and determines directionality (RTL/LTR) and font selection.\n- Tailwind configuration: Extends the theme with custom colors (syrian-green, syrian-red, gold) and fonts (Bahij Koufiya for Arabic, Roboto for English/Turkish).\n- index.css: Defines CSS variables for custom colors and gradients, and provides utility classes for glass-like backgrounds and glow effects.\n- eventData: Supplies event metadata (date, time, venue) used by the component.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe DetailsSection composes three cards inside a responsive grid. Each card uses Lucide icons and displays translated content from the LanguageContext. The Location card opens an external Google Maps link in a new tab with safe attributes. The section’s background uses the custom green color from the theme, and a watermark image is overlaid behind the content.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"UI Layer\"\n    DS[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"]\n    CARD1[\"Date Card\"]\n    CARD2[\"Time Card\"]\n    CARD3[\"Location Card (a)\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Styling\"\n    TWCFG[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n    IDXCSS[\"index.css\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Localization\"\n    LCTX[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n    T[\"t() function\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Data\"\n    EDATA[\"eventData.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  DS --\u003e CARD1\n  DS --\u003e CARD2\n  DS --\u003e CARD3\n  DS --\u003e LCTX\n  DS --\u003e TWCFG\n  DS --\u003e IDXCSS\n  DS --\u003e EDATA\n  LCTX --\u003e T\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Layout and Theming\n- Background theme: The section uses a green background derived from the custom color palette. The green color is defined in CSS variables and mapped to Tailwind’s theme.\n- Watermark: A decorative Syrian flag image is centered absolutely with reduced opacity and blur to serve as a subtle background texture.\n- Responsive grid: The cards are arranged in a single column on small screens and three columns on medium screens and above, using Tailwind’s responsive grid utilities.\n\nAccessibility and responsiveness:\n- Directionality: The app sets the HTML dir attribute based on the selected language, ensuring proper text directionality.\n- Fonts: The application selects a font family based on the current language, aligning with the theme’s typography choices.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n### Date Card\n- Purpose: Displays the event date and day name.\n- Implementation: Uses the Calendar icon and renders translated labels and values via t().\n- Visuals: Hover effect scales the icon container slightly; the card maintains a translucent background with borders for depth.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L23-L32)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### Time Card\n- Purpose: Shows the event time range and a timezone note.\n- Implementation: Uses the Clock icon and translates labels and time values.\n- Visuals: Similar hover behavior to the Date card, maintaining consistent interaction patterns.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L34-L42)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### Location Card (Google Maps Integration)\n- Purpose: Presents the venue name and address and opens the event location in Google Maps.\n- Implementation: Implemented as an anchor element with target and rel attributes for safe external linking. The link points to a Google Maps short URL.\n- Visuals: Translucent card with hover effects mirroring the other cards. Includes a “View Map” label styled as a link-like indicator.\n\nAccessibility and mobile considerations:\n- Link semantics: The anchor element provides semantic link behavior for assistive technologies.\n- External link safety: Uses target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to prevent tabnabbing and reverse tabnabbing.\n- Mobile behavior: Opening external maps apps depends on device configuration. If the link does not open a map app, users can copy the URL and open it manually in a browser or a dedicated maps app.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L44-L58)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n### Icons and Translations\n- Icons: Lucide React icons (Calendar, Clock, MapPin) are used consistently across cards to convey meaning quickly.\n- Translations: The t() function retrieves localized strings for labels and values. The LanguageContext manages translations for Arabic, English, and Turkish.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### Responsive Text Sizing\n- Typography: Headings and labels use relative sizes with responsive modifiers (e.g., text-3xl on small screens, text-4xl on medium screens). Body text sizes scale accordingly to improve readability on various devices.\n- Font families: The application switches between Bahij Koufiya (Arabic) and Roboto (English/Turkish) based on the current language.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n### Hover Effects and Interaction Patterns\n- Cards: Each card uses a group hover state to scale the icon container and adjust background opacity, providing clear affordance for interactivity.\n- Consistency: The same hover pattern is applied across all three cards to maintain a cohesive user experience.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L23-L58)\n\n### Watermark Decoration\n- Placement: The Syrian flag watermark is absolutely positioned at the center of the section with reduced opacity and blur to avoid distracting from content.\n- Responsiveness: The watermark remains centered regardless of screen size.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L9-L13)\n\n### Updating Event Details\n- Where to update: Event metadata such as date, time, venue name, and address are defined in the eventData module.\n- How to update: Modify the relevant fields in eventData. The DetailsSection reads these values through the t() function and displays them in the cards.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L23-L58)\n\n### Customizing the Color Scheme\n- Theme colors: The custom green color is defined in CSS variables and exposed through Tailwind’s theme. You can adjust the green hue/saturation/lightness in index.css to change the overall tone.\n- Card backgrounds: Cards use translucent backgrounds with borders; adjust the opacity and border colors in the component’s Tailwind classes to fine-tune contrast.\n- Gradient utilities: The theme defines gradient utilities; you can reuse or modify these for consistent branding.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nThe DetailsSection depends on:\n- LanguageContext for translations\n- Tailwind theme for colors and responsive utilities\n- index.css for custom color variables and utilities\n- eventData for event metadata\n- Lucide icons for visual representation\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  DS[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"] --\u003e LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  DS --\u003e TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  DS --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  DS --\u003e E[\"eventData.ts\"]\n  DS --\u003e ICONS[\"Lucide Icons\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Image watermark: The flag watermark is blurred and scaled down; keep the image optimized to minimize render cost.\n- Transitions: The hover scale effect is lightweight; ensure no heavy computations occur during hover to maintain smooth interactions.\n- External link: Opening Google Maps is off-DOM; avoid unnecessary re-renders by keeping the anchor static.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- External link not opening on mobile:\n  - Some devices require explicit user gesture to open external applications. Try tapping the “View Map” label or copying the URL and pasting into a browser.\n  - Confirm the Google Maps URL is correct and reachable.\n- Link security warnings:\n  - The component uses target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\". Verify these attributes remain intact if you customize the Location card.\n- Translation not appearing:\n  - Ensure keys used by t() exist in the LanguageContext translation map for the current language.\n- Color contrast:\n  - If text appears hard to read, adjust the card background opacity or text color classes in the component.\n- Responsive layout:\n  - On narrow screens, the cards stack vertically. If alignment looks off, verify Tailwind grid classes and container constraints.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L44-L58)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe DetailsSection component delivers a visually coherent, accessible presentation of event essentials. Its green-themed design, translational flexibility, and responsive layout ensure usability across languages and devices.
