Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive data model documentation for input components that capture user data.

The components are designed to capture user data efficiently while supporting accessibility and internationalization requirements. The implementation leverages React with Radix UI primitives and react-hook-form for state management.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [input.tsx](file://src/components/ui/input.tsx#L1-L23)\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L130)\n\n## Text Input Components\n\n### Input Component\nThe Input component is a controlled text input field that supports various HTML input types. It extends native input props through React.ComponentProps\u003c\"input\"\u003e and applies consistent styling using Tailwind CSS classes. The component handles RTL language support through standard browser behavior and responsive design.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [input.tsx](file://src/components/ui/input.tsx#L5-L22)\n\n### Textarea Component\nThe Textarea component provides a multi-line text input with a minimum height of 80px. It extends React.TextareaHTMLAttributes\u003cHTMLTextAreaElement\u003e to support all standard textarea properties. The component includes focus states and disabled styling for consistent user experience.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [textarea.tsx](file://src/components/ui/textarea.tsx#L7-L21)\n\n### InputOTP Component\nThe InputOTP component implements a one-time password input with individual digit slots. It uses the input-otp library to manage the OTP input state and provides visual feedback with caret blinking animation. The component supports grouping and separation of digits with customizable separators.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class InputOTP {\n        +containerClassName: string\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class InputOTPGroup {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class InputOTPSlot {\n        +index: number\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class InputOTPSeparator {\n    }\n    \n    InputOTP --\u003e InputOTPGroup : \"contains\"\n    InputOTPGroup --\u003e InputOTPSlot : \"contains\"\n    InputOTPSlot --\u003e InputOTPSeparator : \"separated by\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [input-otp.tsx](file://src/components/ui/input-otp.tsx#L7-L61)\n\n## Boolean Input Components\n\n### Checkbox Component\nThe Checkbox component implements a binary selection control using Radix UI's CheckboxPrimitive. It displays a check icon when selected and provides visual feedback for hover, focus, and disabled states. The component uses data attributes to manage its visual state.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [checkbox.tsx](file://src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx#L7-L26)\n\n### RadioGroup Component\nThe RadioGroup component provides a set of mutually exclusive options. It uses a grid layout to arrange radio items and implements proper keyboard navigation. Each RadioGroupItem displays a circular indicator that fills when selected.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class RadioGroup {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class RadioGroupItem {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    RadioGroup --\u003e RadioGroupItem : \"contains\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [radio-group.tsx](file://src/components/ui/radio-group.tsx#L7-L36)\n\n### Switch Component\nThe Switch component implements a toggle control with smooth transition animations. It uses a sliding thumb that moves between left (unchecked) and right (checked) positions. The component provides visual feedback through border and background color changes on interaction.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [switch.tsx](file://src/components/ui/switch.tsx#L6-L27)\n\n## Numeric and Selection Input Components\n\n### Slider Component\nThe Slider component allows users to select a value from a continuous range. It displays a track with a draggable thumb and a filled range indicator. The component supports touch interactions and provides visual feedback for focus states.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [slider.tsx](file://src/components/ui/slider.tsx#L6-L23)\n\n### Select Component\nThe Select component implements a dropdown menu for selecting from a list of options. It consists of multiple subcomponents including Trigger, Content, Item, and Scroll buttons. The component supports keyboard navigation and displays a chevron icon to indicate the dropdown functionality.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Select {\n    }\n    \n    class SelectTrigger {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class SelectContent {\n        +className: string\n        +position: string\n    }\n    \n    class SelectItem {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class SelectGroup {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class SelectLabel {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    Select --\u003e SelectTrigger : \"trigger\"\n    Select --\u003e SelectContent : \"content\"\n    SelectContent --\u003e SelectItem : \"contains\"\n    SelectContent --\u003e SelectGroup : \"contains\"\n    SelectGroup --\u003e SelectItem : \"contains\"\n    SelectGroup --\u003e SelectLabel : \"contains\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [select.tsx](file://src/components/ui/select.tsx#L7-L143)\n\n## Form Integration and State Management\n\n### Form Component Architecture\nThe form system integrates react-hook-form with custom UI components to provide a seamless form experience. The Form component acts as a provider for form context, while FormField wraps individual form controls with controller functionality.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Form {\n        +children: ReactNode\n    }\n    \n    class FormField {\n        +name: string\n        +control: Control\n        +render: function\n    }\n    \n    class FormItem {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class FormLabel {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class FormControl {\n    }\n    \n    class FormDescription {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class FormMessage {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    Form --\u003e FormField : \"contains\"\n    FormField --\u003e FormItem : \"renders\"\n    FormItem --\u003e FormLabel : \"contains\"\n    FormItem --\u003e FormControl : \"contains\"\n    FormItem --\u003e FormDescription : \"contains\"\n    FormItem --\u003e FormMessage : \"contains\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L130)\n\n### State Management Pattern\nThe form system uses React context to manage field state and validation. The useFormField hook provides access to field state including error status, touched status, and validation messages. This pattern enables components to respond appropriately to form validation states.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L33-L54)\n\n## Accessibility Implementation\n\n### Label Association\nAll form components implement proper label association using the FormLabel component. The system generates unique IDs for form items and associates them with their corresponding labels and error messages using aria-labelledby and aria-describedby attributes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [label.tsx](file://src/components/ui/label.tsx#L9-L17)\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L75-L83)\n\n### Error Messaging\nThe FormMessage component displays validation errors with appropriate styling and ARIA attributes. Error messages are announced by screen readers through aria-invalid and are visually distinguished with destructive color styling.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L111-L127)\n\n### Keyboard Operability\nAll interactive components support keyboard navigation and focus management. The implementation follows WAI-ARIA practices for each component type, ensuring that users can interact with all controls using only a keyboard.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [checkbox.tsx](file://src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx#L7-L26)\n- [radio-group.tsx](file://src/components/ui/radio-group.tsx#L7-L36)\n- [select.tsx](file://src/components/ui/select.tsx#L13-L31)\n\n## Internationalization Considerations\n\n### RTL Language Support\nThe input components support RTL languages through standard CSS and HTML attributes. The application uses a LanguageContext to manage the current language setting, which affects text direction and component layout for Arabic and other RTL languages.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class LanguageContext {\n        +language: string\n        +t: function\n        +setLanguage: function\n    }\n    \n    class RegistrationSection {\n        +title: string\n        +subtitle: string\n        +buttonText: string\n    }\n    \n    RegistrationSection --\u003e LanguageContext : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n### Date and Number Formatting\nThe Calendar component integrates with react-day-picker to support international date formatting. While specific number formatting implementations are not visible in the provided code, the system is structured to support locale-specific formatting through the internationalization framework.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [calendar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/calendar.tsx#L1-L55)\n\n## Common Issues and Troubleshooting\n\n### IME Composition in Arabic\nInput components may experience issues with IME (Input Method Editor) composition when entering Arabic text. The standard HTML input elements handle most IME behavior automatically, but custom implementations should ensure they don't interfere with composition events.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [input.tsx](file://src/components/ui/input.tsx#L5-L22)\n- [textarea.tsx](file://src/components/ui/textarea.tsx#L7-L21)\n\n### Touch Input on Mobile Sliders\nThe Slider component may have usability issues on mobile devices due to small touch targets. The implementation provides a 5px by 5px thumb which may be difficult to manipulate on touch screens. Consider increasing the touch target size or providing alternative input methods for mobile users.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [slider.tsx](file://src/components/ui/slider.tsx#L6-L23)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe input component system provides a comprehensive set of controls for capturing user data with consistent styling and behavior.
