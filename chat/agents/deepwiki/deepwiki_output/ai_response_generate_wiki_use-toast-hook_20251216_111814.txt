Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive documentation for the useToast custom hook, detailing its reducer-based state management architecture. Explain the core state structure (ToasterToast) with fields like id, title, description, action, and open status. Document the four action types (ADD_TOAST, UPDATE_TOAST, DISMISS_TOAST, REMOVE_TOAST) and their role in managing toast lifecycle. Describe the singleton pattern using memoryState and global listeners array to enable toast functionality without React context. Explain the toast() function's role in generating unique IDs via genId(), dispatching ADD_TOAST actions, and returning dismiss/update methods for imperative control. Detail the timeout mechanism in addToRemoveQueue that automatically removes toasts after TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY. Illustrate integration with UI components such as Toaster and Sonner in the component tree. Provide usage examples for success/error toasts in form submissions. Address performance considerations including memory management of timeout references, prevention of toast queue overflow via TOAST_LIMIT, and efficient state updates. Include troubleshooting tips for issues like toasts not disappearing, duplicate toasts appearing, or memory leaks from uncleaned timeouts. Document testing strategies for this hook using Jest timers and mock dispatch verification.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nuseToast Hook\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

Document the four action types (ADD_TOAST, UPDATE_TOAST, DISMISS_TOAST, REMOVE_TOAST) and their role in managing toast lifecycle. Describe the singleton pattern using memoryState and global listeners array to enable toast functionality without React context. Explain the toast() function's role in generating unique IDs via genId(), dispatching ADD_TOAST actions, and returning dismiss/update methods for imperative control. Detail the timeout mechanism in addToRemoveQueue that automatically removes toasts after TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY. Illustrate integration with UI components such as Toaster and Sonner in the component tree. Provide usage examples for success/error toasts in form submissions. Address performance considerations including memory management of timeout references, prevention of toast queue overflow via TOAST_LIMIT, and efficient state updates. Include troubleshooting tips for issues like toasts not disappearing, duplicate toasts appearing, or memory leaks from uncleaned timeouts.

Describe the singleton pattern using memoryState and global listeners array to enable toast functionality without React context. Explain the toast() function's role in generating unique IDs via genId(), dispatching ADD_TOAST actions, and returning dismiss/update methods for imperative control. Detail the timeout mechanism in addToRemoveQueue that automatically removes toasts after TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY. Illustrate integration with UI components such as Toaster and Sonner in the component tree. Provide usage examples for success/error toasts in form submissions. Address performance considerations including memory management of timeout references, prevention of toast queue overflow via TOAST_LIMIT, and efficient state updates. Include troubleshooting tips for issues like toasts not disappearing, duplicate toasts appearing, or memory leaks from uncleaned timeouts.

Document the four action types (ADD_TOAST, UPDATE_TOAST, DISMISS_TOAST, REMOVE_TOAST) and their role in managing toast lifecycle. Describe the singleton pattern using memoryState and global listeners array to enable toast functionality without React context. Explain the toast() function's role in generating unique IDs via genId(), dispatching ADD_TOAST actions, and returning dismiss/update methods for imperative control. Detail the timeout mechanism in addToRemoveQueue that automatically removes toasts after TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY. Illustrate integration with UI components such as Toaster and Sonner in the component tree. Provide usage examples for success/error toasts in form submissions. Address performance considerations including memory management of timeout references, prevention of toast queue overflow via TOAST_LIMIT, and efficient state updates. Include troubleshooting tips for issues like toasts not disappearing, duplicate toasts appearing, or memory leaks from uncleaned timeouts.

It covers the state model, action types, singleton pattern, imperative toast API, timeout-based lifecycle, UI integration, usage patterns, performance, troubleshooting, and testing strategies.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe useToast hook is implemented as a standalone reducer with a singleton state and a listener registry. It is consumed by UI components that render toasts and by the application shell to mount toast providers.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Hooks\"\n    UT[\"use-toast.ts\u003cbr/\u003eReducer + Singleton + API\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"UI Components\"\n    TComp[\"toast.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eRadix Toast primitives\"]\n    ToasterC[\"toaster.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eToaster renderer\"]\n    SonnerC[\"sonner.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eAlternative provider\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"App Shell\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eMounts Toaster + Sonner\"]\n  end\n\n  UT --\u003e ToasterC\n  UT --\u003e SonnerC\n  ToasterC --\u003e TComp\n  App --\u003e ToasterC\n  App --\u003e SonnerC\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L186)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L1-L112)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L186)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L1-L112)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Core Components\n- Reducer and state model\n  - State: an object containing a toasts array.\n  - Action types: ADD_TOAST, UPDATE_TOAST, DISMISS_TOAST, REMOVE_TOAST.\n  - Reducer enforces a TOAST_LIMIT and manages open state transitions.\n- Singleton pattern\n  - memoryState holds the current state.\n  - listeners array notifies subscribers when state changes.\n  - dispatch updates memoryState and invokes listeners.\n- Imperative API\n  - toast(props) generates a unique id, adds a toast, and returns { id, dismiss, update }.\n  - useToast() returns the current state plus toast and dismiss helpers.\n- Timeout-based lifecycle\n  - addToRemoveQueue schedules removal after TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY.\n  - toast.onOpenChange triggers dismissal when the toast closes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L186)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe hook uses a reducer with a singleton memoryState and a global listeners registry. Components subscribe via useToast() and receive updates through React state. Two providers are available: a Radix-based Toaster and a Sonner-based Toaster.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Caller as \"Component\"\n  participant Hook as \"useToast/use-toast.ts\"\n  participant Provider as \"Toaster/Sonner\"\n  participant UI as \"toast.tsx\"\n\n  Caller-\u003e\u003eHook: toast({ title, description, ... })\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eHook: genId()\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eHook: dispatch({ type: \"ADD_TOAST\", toast })\n  Hook--\u003e\u003eCaller: { id, dismiss, update }\n\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eProvider: listeners notify state change\n  Provider-\u003e\u003eUI: render toasts\n  UI--\u003e\u003eProvider: onOpenChange(false)\n  Provider-\u003e\u003eHook: dispatch({ type: \"DISMISS_TOAST\", toastId })\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eHook: addToRemoveQueue(toastId)\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eHook: setTimeout -\u003e dispatch({ type: \"REMOVE_TOAST\", toastId })\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L186)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L1-L112)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Reducer and State Model\n- State interface\n  -

Generates id via genId().\n  - Returns update and dismiss functions bound to that id.\n  - Dispatches ADD_TOAST with open=true and onOpenChange to trigger dismissal.\n- useToast()\n  - Returns current state and helpers: toast, dismiss.\n- dismiss(toastId?)\n  - Dispatches DISMISS_TOAST for a specific id or all.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Comp as \"Component\"\n  participant Hook as \"useToast/use-toast.ts\"\n  participant Disp as \"dispatch\"\n  participant Red as \"reducer\"\n\n  Comp-\u003e\u003eHook: toast({ title, description })\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eHook: genId()\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eDisp: { type: \"ADD_TOAST\", toast: { id, open: true, onOpenChange } }\n  Disp-\u003e\u003eRed: reducer(memoryState, action)\n  Red--\u003e\u003eDisp: new memoryState\n  Disp--\u003e\u003eComp: { id, dismiss, update }\n\n  Comp-\u003e\u003eHook: dismiss(id)\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eDisp: { type: \"DISMISS_TOAST\", toastId: id }\n  Disp-\u003e\u003eRed: reducer(...)\n  Red--\u003e\u003eDisp: new memoryState\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L135-L164)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L166-L184)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L135-L164)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L166-L184)\n\n### Timeout Mechanism and Lifecycle\n- addToRemoveQueue\n  - Prevents duplicate timers for the same id.\n  - Schedules a timeout to dispatch REMOVE_TOAST after TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY.\n  - Removes the timer reference from the Map when triggered.\n- TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY is set to a large value in this implementation.\n- UI onOpenChange triggers dismissal when the toast closes.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Enter([\"Dismiss Request\"]) --\u003e HasTimer{\"Timer exists for id?\"}\n  HasTimer --\u003e|Yes| Skip[\"Skip scheduling\"]\n  HasTimer --\u003e|No| Schedule[\"setTimeout(TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY)\"]\n  Schedule --\u003e Store[\"Store timeout in Map\"]\n  Store --\u003e Trigger[\"On timeout: delete from Map\u003cbr/\u003edispatch REMOVE_TOAST\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L53-L69)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L147-L157)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L53-L69)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L147-L157)\n\n### UI Integration: Toaster and Sonner\n- Toaster component\n  - Uses useToast() to render toasts.\n  - Renders title, description, action, and close button.\n- Sonner Toaster\n  - Provides an alternative toast provider with theming and styling options.\n- App mounts both providers to support different UI stacks.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  App[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e T1[\"Toaster (Radix)\"]\n  App --\u003e T2[\"Toaster (Sonner)\"]\n  T1 --\u003e U1[\"toaster.tsx\"]\n  T2 --\u003e U2[\"sonner.tsx\"]\n  U1 --\u003e H[\"use-toast.ts\"]\n  U2 --\u003e H\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L186)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n\n### Usage Examples\n- Success toast in a form submission\n  - Call toast({ title, description, variant: \"default\" }) after successful submission.\n  - Optionally attach an action button for user follow-up.\n- Error toast in a form submission\n  - Call toast({ title, description, variant: \"destructive\" }) on failure.\n  - Provide an action to retry or show details.\n- Notes\n  - The UI components accept variant and other props compatible with Radix Toast.\n  - Sonner’s Toaster can be used for a different visual style.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides usage guidance without quoting specific files]\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Internal dependencies\n  - use-toast.ts depends on toast.tsx types for ToasterToast and ToastActionElement.\n  - toaster.tsx consumes useToast() and renders Radix Toast components.\n  - sonner.tsx re-exports Sonner’s Toaster and toast for alternative rendering.\n- External dependencies\n  - @radix-ui/react-toast for native toast primitives.\n  - lucide-react for icons.\n  - next-themes for theme-aware Sonner styling.\n- Coupling and cohesion\n  - The hook is cohesive and decoupled from UI; UI components depend on the hook, not vice versa.\n  - Providers (Toaster, Sonner) are independent and interchangeable.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  UT[\"use-toast.ts\"] --\u003e TP[\"toast.tsx\"]\n  UT --\u003e TS[\"toaster.tsx\"]\n  UT --\u003e SN[\"sonner.tsx\"]\n  TS --\u003e TP\n  App[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e TS\n  App --\u003e SN\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L186)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L1-L112)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L186)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L1-L112)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Memory management\n  - addToRemoveQueue stores timers in a Map keyed by toast id. On timeout, the entry is deleted before dispatching REMOVE_TOAST.\n  - Ensure listeners are removed on component unmount to prevent stale subscriptions.\n- Queue overflow prevention\n  - TOAST_LIMIT is set to 1, enforcing a single toast at a time.\n- Efficient state updates\n  - reducer operations are O(n) over the toasts array; with TOAST_LIMIT=1, operations remain fast.\n- Timeout duration\n  - TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY is set to a large value in this implementation. Consider tuning for UX and memory pressure.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L5-L7)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L71-L122)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L166-L184)\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Toasts not disappearing\n  - Verify onOpenChange is wired so that closing triggers dismissal.\n  - Confirm addToRemoveQueue is invoked and timers are not duplicated.\n  - Check that listeners are active and dispatch is called.\n- Duplicate toasts\n  - Ensure each toast is created with a unique id generated by genId().\n  - Respect TOAST_LIMIT to avoid stacking multiple toasts.\n- Memory leaks from uncleaned timeouts\n  - addToRemoveQueue deletes entries from the Map on timeout.\n  - Ensure listeners are removed on unmount to avoid stale references.\n- UI not rendering toasts\n  - Confirm Toaster or Sonner is mounted in the app shell.\n  - Ensure useToast() is called inside a component tree that receives state updates.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L135-L164)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L166-L184)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Testing Strategies\n- Jest timers\n  - Use jest.useFakeTimers() and jest.advanceTimersByTime() to control TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY.\n  - Advance time past TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY to verify REMOVE_TOAST dispatch.\n- Mock dispatch verification\n  - Spy on dispatch to assert ADD_TOAST, UPDATE_TOAST, DISMISS_TOAST, and REMOVE_TOAST calls.\n  - Verify that addToRemoveQueue schedules a single timeout per toast id.\n- Component-level tests\n  - Render Toaster and trigger toast() via useToast().\n  - Assert DOM updates for title, description, and action.\n- Unmount cleanup\n  - Test that listeners are removed on unmount to prevent memory leaks.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general testing guidance]\n\n## Conclusion\nThe useToast hook implements a robust, reducer-based, singleton-driven toast system with an imperative API and a clean separation of concerns. Its integration with both Radix and Sonner providers offers flexibility in UI presentation. By adhering to the patterns described—respecting TOAST_LIMIT, ensuring listener cleanup, and controlling timers—you can build reliable, performant toast experiences.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-f24e3d6d-d3b1-4890-a9d9-244d4c558b4c","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":29356,"completion_tokens":4027,"total_tokens":33383,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
