Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for responsive design implementation using Tailwind's breakpoint system. Explain how the configuration in tailwind.config.ts defines responsive containers and how components adapt across mobile, tablet, and desktop views. Detail the use of Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) in components like Navbar, Sidebar, and Grid layouts to create adaptive interfaces. Describe how the use-mobile.tsx hook complements CSS-based responsiveness with JavaScript detection for conditional rendering. Illustrate with examples from the codebase such as the mobile drawer navigation versus desktop sidebar, or responsive typography scaling with font-koufiya. Address common responsive design challenges like viewport scaling on mobile devices and provide solutions for ensuring consistent layout behavior across different screen sizes.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nResponsive Design\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers:\n- How the Tailwind configuration defines responsive containers and breakpoints\n- How components adapt across mobile, tablet, and desktop views using Tailwind’s responsive prefixes\n- How the use-mobile hook complements CSS-based responsiveness with JavaScript detection for conditional rendering\n- Practical examples from the codebase, including mobile drawer navigation versus desktop sidebar and responsive typography scaling with font families\n\n## Project Structure\nThe project organizes responsive concerns across configuration, global styles, and components:\n- Tailwind configuration controls container widths and theme extensions\n- Global CSS applies fonts and base styles\n- Components use Tailwind utilities and the use-mobile hook to adapt behavior\n- Pages assemble sections that demonstrate responsive grids and typography\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  A[\"tailwind.config.ts\"] --\u003e B[\"index.css\"]\n  B --\u003e C[\"App.tsx\"]\n  C --\u003e

and base styles, including a custom font family for typography scaling\n- App wrapper: Chooses font families based on language for responsive typography\n- use-mobile hook: Provides JavaScript-based device detection for conditional rendering\n- Navbar: Uses Tailwind responsive utilities and a mobile drawer for small screens\n- Sidebar: Uses the use-mobile hook to switch between a Sheet-based off-canvas on mobile and a desktop sidebar\n- Sections: Demonstrate responsive grids and typography scaling\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n-

Container-aware: Tailwind container configuration constrains content width at larger screens\n- JavaScript-based: use-mobile hook detects device width to drive conditional rendering\n- Typography-driven: Fonts are selected per language to improve readability across locales\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant U as \"User Agent\"\n  participant CSS as \"Tailwind

Component Analysis\n\n### Tailwind Breakpoints and Container Configuration\n- Container configuration centers content and sets a maximum width for extra-large screens\n- Theme extensions define color palettes and keyframe animations used across responsive components\n- These settings enable consistent spacing and layout scaling across breakpoints\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Tailwind Config\"]) --\u003e Container[\"Container Center\u003cbr/\u003ePadding\u003cbr/\u003eScreens\"]\n  Container --\u003e Extend[\"Theme Extensions\u003cbr/\u003eColors, Radii, Keyframes\"]\n  Extend

applies a custom font family for Arabic and a fallback for other languages\n- App-level selection switches between font families depending on the active language\n- Sections use responsive text sizing utilities to scale headings and content across breakpoints\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant App as \"App.tsx\"\n  participant Lang as \"LanguageContext\"\n  participant CSS as

screens and show on medium-sized screens and above\n- Mobile navigation toggles a drawer-like overlay controlled by state\n- The component demonstrates breakpoint-specific visibility and layout adjustments\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Nav as \"Navbar.tsx\"\n  participant Drawer as \"Drawer Component\"\n  participant Sidebar as \"Sidebar

[drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L1-L88)\n\n### Sidebar: Off-canvas on Mobile, Desktop Sidebar\n- The Sidebar component uses the use-mobile hook to decide between:\n  - A Sheet-based off-canvas on mobile devices\n  - A desktop sidebar with collapsible behavior\n- This hybrid approach ensures optimal UX across screen sizes\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Hook as \"use-mobile.tsx\"\n  participant SB as \"Sidebar.tsx\"\n  participant Sheet as \"Drawer Sheet\"\n  participant Desk as \"Desktop Sidebar\"\n\n  Hook--\u003e\u003eSB: isMobile flag\n  alt Mobile\n

[sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx#L1-L638)\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n\n### Grid Layouts: Responsive Columns\n- Sections use responsive grid utilities to adjust column counts across breakpoints\n- This ensures content remains readable and well-spaced on all devices\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  A[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"] --\u003e B[\"Grid Columns 1 on small\"]\n  B --\u003e C[\"Grid Columns 2 on medium\"]\n  C --\u003e D[\"Grid Columns 3 on large\"]\n  E[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"] --\u003e F[\"Columns 1 on small\"]\n  F --\u003e

[DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nResponsive design depends on coordinated layers:\n- Tailwind configuration influences the availability and behavior of responsive utilities\n- Global CSS establishes baseline fonts and styles\n- App-level logic selects fonts per language\n- Components rely on Tailwind utilities and the use-mobile hook for runtime decisions\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  T[\"tailwind.config.ts\"] --\u003e U[\"Tailwind Utilities\"]\n  U --\u003e N[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n  U --\u003e H[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n  U --\u003e

runtime calculations for layout changes\n- Minimize heavy computations in effect handlers; the use-mobile hook measures once and updates on media query changes\n- Use container utilities to prevent excessive horizontal scrolling on small screens\n- Keep font loading efficient; the project already uses font-display swap for custom fonts\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon responsive design challenges and solutions:\n- Viewport scaling on mobile devices\n  - Ensure the viewport meta tag is configured in the HTML template (not shown in this repository snapshot)\n  - Use Tailwind’s container utilities to constrain content width on large screens\n  - Verify that the use-mobile hook returns the expected value on resize events\n- Inconsistent layout behavior across screen sizes\n  - Confirm Tailwind breakpoint prefixes match intended breakpoints\n  - Validate that components conditionally render based on the use-mobile hook on small screens\n  - Check that grid layouts use appropriate responsive column utilities\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n-

detection:\n- Tailwind configuration defines container widths and theme extensions\n- Global CSS applies fonts and base styles\n- App-level logic selects fonts per language\n- Components use responsive utilities and the use-mobile hook to adapt navigation and layout across devices\n- Sections demonstrate responsive grids and typography scaling\n\nThis layered approach ensures consistent, accessible experiences across mobile, tablet, and desktop views while maintaining clean, maintainable code.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-9ef21246-25e7-4596-bdd1-708c13f47cc0","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":35845,"completion_tokens":3736,"total_tokens":39581,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
