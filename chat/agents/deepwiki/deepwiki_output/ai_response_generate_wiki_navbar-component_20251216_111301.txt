Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the Navbar component that serves as the primary navigation hub for the event platform. Explain how it implements a responsive design with a mobile-first approach, using state management to toggle visibility of the mobile menu. Detail the integration of scroll detection to dynamically change the navbar's appearance when scrolling down the page. Describe the implementation of smooth scrolling to section anchors via the scrollToSection function and how it prevents default anchor behavior. Illustrate how the Navbar integrates with the LanguageSwitcher component and responds to RTL layout changes through the isRTL flag from LanguageContext. Include code examples showing event handling for mobile menu toggling and navigation link clicks. Address common issues such as scroll event memory leaks, incorrect mobile menu state management, and accessibility concerns with ARIA labels. Provide performance optimization tips for reducing re-renders using useCallback and minimizing DOM listeners.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nNavbar Component\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It explains how the Navbar implements a mobile-first responsive design, manages mobile menu visibility via state, detects scroll events to dynamically alter its appearance, and integrates with the LanguageSwitcher component. It also covers RTL layout handling through the isRTL flag from LanguageContext, demonstrates event handling for mobile menu toggling and navigation link clicks, and addresses common issues such as scroll event memory leaks, incorrect mobile menu state management, and accessibility concerns. Finally, it offers performance optimization tips to reduce re-renders and minimize DOM listeners.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe Navbar component resides under src/components and integrates with the LanguageContext for internationalization and with LanguageSwitcher for language selection.

Integrates with LanguageSwitcher and reacts to RTL layout changes via isRTL.\n- LanguageSwitcher: Provides language selection with variants for floating and navbar contexts.\n- LanguageContext: Supplies language state, translation function t, and isRTL flag to consumers.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n- Responsive design: Uses hidden and md:flex to show desktop links and reveal a mobile menu on smaller screens.\n- Scroll detection: Adds a scroll listener on mount and removes it on unmount to prevent memory leaks.\n- Smooth scrolling: Prevents default anchor behavior and scrolls to target sections smoothly.\n- RTL support: Applies dir=\"rtl\" or \"ltr\" based on isRTL and translates navigation labels via t.\n- Accessibility: Uses aria-label on the mobile menu toggle button.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe Navbar orchestrates navigation and language switching, while LanguageContext centralizes internationalization.

'rtl' : 'ltr'} to the nav element.\n- App sets global dir and font class based on language.\n\nPaths:\n- Provider and hooks: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- Navbar RTL application: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L45-L46)\n- App global RTL and font: [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L45-L46)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n\n### Scroll Detection and Smooth Scrolling\n- Scroll detection: Navbar adds a scroll listener on mount and removes it on unmount to avoid memory leaks.\n- Smooth scrolling: Prevents default anchor behavior and uses scrollIntoView with smooth behavior to navigate to section anchors.\n\nPaths:\n- Scroll listener lifecycle: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L11-L17)\n- Scroll-to-section function: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L36)\n- Navigation link handlers: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L66-L71), [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L100-L107)\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant W as \"Window\"\n  participant N as \"Navbar\"\n  participant E as \"DOM Element\"\n\n  W-\u003e\u003eN: \"scroll\" event\n  N-\u003e\u003eN: Update isScrolled based on scrollY\n  N--\u003e\u003eW: Styles update (optional)\n\n  U-\u003e\u003eN: Click nav link\n  N-\u003e\u003eN: Prevent default anchor behavior\n  N-\u003e\u003eE: Query selector by href\n  E--\u003e\u003eN: Element reference\n  N-\u003e\u003eE: ScrollIntoView({behavior:\"smooth\"})\n  N-\u003e\u003eN: Close mobile menu if open\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L11-L17)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L36)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L66-L71)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L100-L107)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L11-L17)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L36)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L66-L71)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L100-L107)\n\n### Mobile-First Design and State Management\n- Mobile-first: Desktop navigation is hidden on small screens; mobile menu is shown via a hamburger icon.\n- State management: isMobileMenuOpen controls visibility of the mobile menu.\n- Conditional rendering: Mobile menu appears only when isMobileMenuOpen is true.\n\nPaths:\n- Mobile menu toggle: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L84-L90)\n- Mobile menu visibility: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L95-L116)\n- Desktop navigation: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L62-L76)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L84-L90)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L95-L116)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L62-L76)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nThe Navbar depends on:\n- LanguageContext for translations and RTL flag.\n- LanguageSwitcher for language selection UI.\n- Index page for composition within the app.\n- App.tsx for provider setup.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e NAV[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n  LS[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"] --\u003e NAV\n  IDX[\"Index.tsx\"] --\u003e NAV\n  APP[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e LC\n  APP --\u003e IDX\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Avoid scroll event memory leaks: Ensure the scroll listener is removed on unmount. The Navbar already implements this correctly.\n- Reduce re-renders:\n  - Memoize handlers using useCallback for scrollToSection and toggle handlers if they are passed down to child components.\n  - Wrap LanguageSwitcher with memoization if props do not change frequently.\n  - Consider extracting navigation items to a constant outside the component to avoid recreating arrays on each render.\n- Minimize DOM listeners:\n  - Keep a single scroll listener as implemented.\n  - Debounce scroll handlers if adding heavy computations (not required for simple style updates).\n- Accessibility:\n  - Ensure the mobile menu toggle has a clear aria-label (already present).\n  - Consider adding aria-expanded to the toggle button reflecting isMobileMenuOpen state.\n  - Ensure keyboard navigation support for mobile menu items.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Scroll event memory leaks:\n  - Symptom: Unexpected behavior after navigating away from the page.\n  - Resolution: Verify that the scroll listener is removed on unmount. The Navbar already does this.\n  - Reference: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L11-L17)\n- Incorrect mobile menu state management:\n  - Symptom: Mobile menu remains open after navigation or does not close on link click.\n  - Resolution: Ensure the mobile menu closes after clicking a link. The Navbar sets isMobileMenuOpen to false after scrolling.\n  - Reference: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L36)\n- Accessibility concerns:\n  - Symptom: Screen reader issues with mobile menu toggle.\n  - Resolution: Confirm aria-label is present and consider adding aria-expanded bound to isMobileMenuOpen.\n  - References: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L87-L90)\n- Smooth scrolling not working:\n  - Symptom: Links do not scroll to sections.\n  - Resolution: Ensure href selectors match actual section IDs and that scrollIntoView is supported. The Navbar prevents default behavior and scrolls to the element.\n  - References: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L36), [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L66-L71), [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L100-L107)\n- RTL layout not applied:\n  - Symptom: Text direction not changing to RTL.\n  - Resolution: Confirm isRTL is true for Arabic and that dir is applied to the nav element.\n  - References: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L45-L46), [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276-L276)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L11-L17)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L36)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L66-L71)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L87-L90)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L100-L107)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L45-L46)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276-L276)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Navbar component delivers a robust, mobile-first navigation experience with scroll-aware styling, smooth scrolling to sections, and seamless integration with the LanguageSwitcher and LanguageContext. It adheres to accessibility best practices and avoids common pitfalls such as scroll event memory leaks. By applying the suggested performance optimizations and following the troubleshooting steps, developers can maintain a reliable and efficient navigation system across locales and screen sizes.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-a989e05f-1c54-4c6f-ba7c-924d7e73d058","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":20644,"completion_tokens":4528,"total_tokens":25172,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
