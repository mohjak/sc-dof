Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the Footer component that provides site credits, social links, and navigation.

It explains the implementation with a dark theme, a three-column responsive layout, and a decorative tricolor top border representing the Syrian flag. It also covers the center-aligned national symbols (Syrian eagle and flag), the right-aligned community logo, social media integration with a custom TikTok icon and standard Lucide icons for Instagram and YouTube, including hover effects and accessibility attributes. Finally, it addresses the bottom bar with copyright information, developer credit, and a GitHub link, along with guidance on updating social media URLs, modifying copyright information, and customizing visual elements.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe Footer component resides under the components directory and integrates with the global design system via Tailwind CSS and the shared color palette. It relies on the LanguageContext for internationalization and uses Lucide icons for Instagram and YouTube while providing a custom SVG for TikTok.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Components\"\n    Footer[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Internationalization\"\n    LangCtx[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Styling\"\n    TailwindCfg[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n    Styles[\"index.css\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"App Shell\"\n    AppShell[\"App.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  Footer --\u003e LangCtx\n  Footer --\u003e TailwindCfg\n  Footer --\u003e Styles\n  AppShell --\u003e Footer\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Core Components\n- Footer.tsx: Implements the footer with:\n  -

LanguageContext for translations\n  - Tailwind CSS and index.css for styling and color tokens\n  - Lucide icons for Instagram and YouTube\n  - Local assets for national symbols and community logo\n- External dependencies:\n  - lucide-react for standard icons\n  - react-router-dom for routing (indirectly via app shell)\n- Asset management:\n  - Assets are imported directly; ensure they exist in the assets directory\n  - References: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L5), [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  Footer[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n  Lang[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  Lucide[\"lucide-react\"]\n  Assets[\"Local assets\u003cbr/\u003eeagle, flag, community logo\"]\n\n  Footer --\u003e Lang\n  Footer --\u003e TW\n  Footer --\u003e CSS\n  Footer --\u003e Lucide\n  Footer --\u003e Assets\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L5)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L5)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Asset loading:\n  - Images are imported statically; ensure they are appropriately sized and compressed to minimize bundle size\n  - Consider lazy-loading for non-critical images if the page becomes heavy\n- Icon rendering:\n  - Using Lucide icons is efficient; keep the number of icon instances reasonable\n- CSS and Tailwind:\n  - The design system is configured centrally; avoid duplicating styles to reduce CSS bloat\n- Accessibility:\n  - Alt texts and aria-labels are present; ensure they remain accurate as visuals change\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Social media links not opening externally:\n  - Ensure target=\"_blank\" and rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" are present on anchor tags\n  - References: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L51-L66), [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L88-L111)\n- Missing alt texts:\n  - Verify alt attributes on all images (national symbols and community logo)\n  - References: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L71-L86)\n- Incorrect social media URLs:\n  - Update the href values in the social links array\n  - References: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L26-L30)\n- Updating copyright information:\n  - Modify the rights text key in translations and ensure the key exists\n  - References: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L89-L96)\n- Customizing visual elements:\n  - Adjust the tricolor border colors via the design system tokens\n  - References: [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L54-L58), [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L68)\n- Ensuring external links open correctly:\n  - Confirm that the app shell does not override window.open behavior\n  - References: [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L26-L30)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L51-L66)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L71-L86)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L88-L111)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L89-L96)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L54-L58)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L68)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Footer component delivers a cohesive, accessible, and thematically aligned presentation of national symbols, social links, and legal information. Its responsive layout, decorative tricolor border, and carefully implemented accessibility attributes ensure a strong user experience across languages and devices. By centralizing styling through the design system and translations through the LanguageContext, future updates to URLs, copy, and visuals can be made efficiently and consistently.\n\n[No sources needed since this section summarizes without analyzing specific files]\n\n## Appendices\n\n### How to Update Social Media URLs\n- Edit the href values in the social links array\n  - Reference: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L26-L30)\n- Add or remove platforms by extending the array with new entries\n  - Reference: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L26-L30)\n\n### How to Modify Copyright Information\n- Update the translation keys for rights text\n  - Reference: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L89-L96)\n- If adding a new link (e.g., a privacy policy), append it to the bottom bar\n  - Reference: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L88-L111)\n\n### How to Customize Visual Elements\n- Change the tricolor border colors via design tokens\n  - Reference: [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L54-L58), [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L68)\n- Adjust hover effects by modifying transition classes on social anchors\n  - Reference: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L51-L66)\n- Update national symbols or community logo by replacing assets and ensuring alt texts remain accurate\n  - Reference: [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L5), [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L71-L86)\n\n### Related Patterns in the Codebase\n- Tricolor divider usage elsewhere in the app:\n  - References: [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L29-L34), [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L9-L13)\n- Hero section with national emblems:\n  - References: [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L36-L67)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L5)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L26-L30)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L51-L66)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L71-L86)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L88-L111)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L89-L96)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L54-L58)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L68)\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L29-L34)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L9-L13)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L36-L67)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-cc78faec-7828-4d19-9856-9c568d75d580","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":35015,"completion_tokens":5362,"total_tokens":40377,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
