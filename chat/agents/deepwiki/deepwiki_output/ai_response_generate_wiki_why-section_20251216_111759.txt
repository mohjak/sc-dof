Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the WhySection component that communicates the event's purpose and motivation.

It uses the translation function t() to present multilingual content for the title and description. Visual elements include a peace dove emoji with a subtle glow animation and a divider composed of the Syrian flag colors to reinforce national identity. The section is responsive across screen sizes and designed with accessibility considerations for color contrast. Guidance is included for modifying messages and visuals for different event themes.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe Why Section is implemented as a standalone component that integrates with the internationalization system and global styles. It relies on:\n- Translation keys under the why namespace\n- Global CSS variables and animations\n- A language provider that supplies the t() function and RTL direction\n- Tailwind utility classes for responsive behavior and layout\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  A[\"WhySection.tsx\"] --\u003e B[\"LanguageContext.tsx\u003cbr/\u003euseLanguage() -\u003e t()\"]\n  A --\u003e C[\"index.css\u003cbr/\u003eCustom colors and animations\"]\n  A --\u003e D[\"App.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageProvider wrapper\"]\n  A --\u003e E[\"eventData.ts\u003cbr/\u003ewhyCelebrate.title/description\"]\n  F[\"HeroSection.tsx\"] -. \"Shared visual language\" .- A\n  G[\"Footer.tsx\"] -. \"Shared visual language\" .- A\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L23-L26)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L103)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L23-L26)\n\n## Core Components\n- WhySection: Renders the full-bleed background image, dark overlay, centered content, and the Syrian flag colors divider. It consumes t() for multilingual title and description.\n- LanguageContext: Provides the t() translation function and manages language state and RTL direction.\n- Global Styles: Define custom colors (including Syrian flag colors) and animations used by the component.\n- App Wrapper: Wraps the app with the LanguageProvider and applies font and direction based on the current language.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n- Full-bleed background image with center/cover/no-repeat positioning\n- Dark overlay for readability\n- Centered content container with max width and padding\n- Responsive typography scaling\n- Peace dove emoji with a pulse-glow animation\n- Syrian flag colors divider\n- Multilingual rendering via t()\n\n**Section sources**\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L161-L248)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe Why Section participates in a layered architecture:\n- Presentation Layer: WhySection renders UI and applies Tailwind classes.\n- Internationalization Layer: LanguageContext exposes t() and isRTL.\n- Styling Layer: index.css defines custom colors and animations.\n- Application Layer: App.tsx wraps the app with LanguageProvider and sets document direction and font family.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant U as \"User\"\n  participant P as \"App.tsx\"\n  participant L as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant W as \"WhySection.tsx\"\n  participant S as \"index.css\"\n\n  U-\u003e\u003eP: \"Load page\"\n  P-\u003e\u003eL: \"Provide language context\"\n  L--\u003e\u003eP: \"language, setLanguage, t(), isRTL\"\n  P--\u003e\u003eU: \"Render with dir and font class\"\n  U-\u003e\u003eW: \"Scroll to Why Section\"\n  W-\u003e\u003eL: \"Call t('why.title')\"\n  W-\u003e\u003eL: \"Call t('why.description')\"\n  L--\u003e\u003eW: \"Localized strings\"\n  W-\u003e\u003eS: \"Apply custom colors and animations\"\n  W--\u003e\u003eU: \"Render full-bleed with overlay and centered content\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L161-L248)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### WhySection Implementation\n- Full-bleed background image: Uses absolute positioning with background cover, center, and no-repeat to stretch the revolution flag across the viewport.\n- Dark overlay: A semi-transparent black overlay improves text legibility against the background.\n- Centered content: A container with max width and auto margins centers the content; typography scales responsively using Tailwind modifiers.\n- Peace dove emoji: A large emoji with a pulse-glow animation draws attention and adds a symbolic touch.\n- Title and description: Rendered using t('why.title') and t('why.description'), enabling multilingual display.\n- Syrian flag colors divider: A horizontal strip composed of three color blocks representing green, white, and black.\n\nResponsive behavior:\n- Vertical height: min-h-[60vh] ensures a minimum height on small screens; py-16 on small screens and py-24 on medium screens increases vertical spacing.\n- Typography: Text scales from text-3xl to text-5xl for headings and from text-xl to text-2xl for paragraphs.\n- Container and divider: Max width and auto margins keep content readable; divider constrained to a max width and horizontally centered.\n\nAccessibility considerations:\n- Color contrast: The dark overlay (black/70) combined with white text enhances contrast for readability.\n- Shadow utilities: drop-shadow utilities improve text legibility against the background.\n- Focusable elements: There are no interactive elements in this section; focus order remains unaffected.\n\nCommon issues and mitigations:\n- Background image loading: Ensure the asset is bundled and accessible at runtime. If the image fails to load, fallback styles should still render readable text.\n- Text legibility: Verify that the overlay opacity and text color combination meet contrast guidelines; adjust overlay intensity if needed.\n- Animation performance: The pulse-glow animation uses CSS transforms and shadows; test on low-power devices and disable if necessary.\n\nModifying for different event themes:\n- Change the background image to reflect the theme while keeping the overlay and layout consistent.\n- Update translation keys under the why namespace to reflect the new message.\n- Adjust the divider colors to align with the event’s brand colors.\n- Modify the emoji to a theme-appropriate symbol if desired.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L161-L248)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L23-L26)\n\n### Internationalization Integration\n- Translation keys: The component uses t('why.title') and t('why.description').\n- Language provider: App.tsx wraps the app with LanguageProvider, which supplies t() and isRTL.\n- Font and direction: The document direction is set to rtl for Arabic and ltr for English/Turkish, and fonts switch accordingly.\n\nPractical usage:\n- Add or modify translation keys in LanguageContext.tsx under the why namespace.\n- Ensure all supported languages include entries for why.title and why.description.\n- Test switching languages to verify content updates seamlessly.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n### Visual Elements and Styling\n- Custom colors: The CSS defines --syrian-green, --syrian-red, and --syrian-black used by the divider and throughout the site.\n- Animations: The pulse-glow animation is defined in index.css and applied to the peace dove emoji.\n- Typography and shadows: Tailwind utilities provide responsive sizing and drop shadows for improved readability.\n\nConsistency with other sections:\n- HeroSection and Footer share visual motifs (Syrian flag imagery and colors), reinforcing a cohesive design language.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L161-L248)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L103)\n\n### Responsive Behavior Across Screen Sizes\n- Mobile-first approach: Base padding and spacing use small-screen defaults; medium and larger screens receive increased spacing and font sizes.\n- Flexible containers: The content container and divider are constrained to a max width and centered, preventing text from becoming too wide on large screens.\n- Overlay and background: The overlay and background image remain full-bleed across breakpoints, ensuring consistent visual impact.\n\nTesting tips:\n- Verify content readability on 320px, 768px, and 1200px widths.\n- Confirm that the divider remains centered and proportionally sized.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n- Color contrast: The dark overlay with white text meets contrast guidelines for readability.\n- Shadow utilities: Drop shadows enhance text visibility against varied backgrounds.\n- Directionality: The document direction switches based on the selected language, ensuring proper layout for Arabic.\n- Focus order: No interactive elements in this section; focus order remains unchanged.\n\nRecommendations:\n- Monitor contrast ratios with varying overlay opacities.\n- Ensure animations can be disabled by users who prefer reduced motion.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L161-L248)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nThe Why Section depends on:\n- LanguageContext for t() and isRTL\n- Global CSS for custom colors and animations\n- Tailwind utilities for responsive layout and typography\n- Asset imports for the background image\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Why[\"WhySection.tsx\"] --\u003e Lang[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  Why --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  Why --\u003e Tailwind[\"Tailwind Utilities\"]\n  Why --\u003e Assets[\"revolution-flag.jpg\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Background image optimization: Ensure the revolution flag image is appropriately sized and compressed to minimize load time.\n- CSS animations: The pulse-glow animation uses lightweight transforms and shadows; keep it enabled for visual appeal.\n- Layout stability: Avoid layout shifts by setting explicit dimensions for the background container and using responsive utilities consistently.\n- Font loading: The font switching occurs at the application level; ensure fonts are preloaded or cached for optimal performance.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Background image not loading:\n  - Verify the asset path and bundling. If the image fails, the overlay and text should still be visible.\n  - Consider adding a fallback background color or placeholder.\n- Text legibility issues:\n  - Adjust the overlay opacity or text color if contrast is insufficient.\n  - Test with different screen brightness and lighting conditions.\n- Animation performance:\n  - Disable or reduce animation intensity on low-power devices if needed.\n- Translation not updating:\n  - Confirm the LanguageProvider is wrapping the app and that keys exist for all languages under the why namespace.\n- Responsive layout problems:\n  - Check Tailwind breakpoints and ensure max-width constraints are appropriate for the content.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L161-L248)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Why Section effectively communicates the event’s purpose through a visually striking full-bleed background, a readable dark overlay, and centered content. Its reliance on the t() function ensures multilingual accessibility, while the peace dove emoji and Syrian flag colors divider reinforce national identity. With responsive design and thoughtful accessibility considerations, the component is robust and adaptable for various event themes.\n\n[No sources needed since this section summarizes without analyzing specific files]\n\n## Appendices\n\n### A.
