Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate architectural documentation for overlay components that provide feedback and contextual information. Cover Alert for status messages, AlertDialog for confirmations, Popover for tooltips and dropdowns, Toast/Toaster/Sonner for notifications, and Tooltip for helper text. Explain their shared patterns: portal rendering, escape key dismissal, click-outside closing, and animation via Tailwind transitions. Document accessibility requirements like live regions for screen readers and focus management. Provide usage examples: Alert for registration feedback, Toast for language switch confirmation. Address z-index stacking issues and mobile responsiveness. Include performance tips like limiting toast duration and using requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nOverlay Components\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It focuses on Alert for status messages, AlertDialog for confirmations, Popover for tooltips and dropdowns, Toast/Toaster/Sonner for notifications, and Tooltip for helper text. It explains shared patterns such as portal rendering, escape key dismissal, click-outside closing, and Tailwind-driven animations. It also covers accessibility requirements (live regions and focus management), z-index stacking, mobile responsiveness, and performance tips.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe overlay components are implemented as reusable UI primitives under the ui folder. They integrate with Radix UI primitives for accessible base behavior and Tailwind classes for styling and animations. The App bootstraps providers for tooltips and toasts, and exposes a Sonner-based Toaster for global notifications.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Providers\"\n    TP[\"Tooltip Provider\u003cbr/\u003etooltip.tsx\"]\n    AP[\"App Providers\u003cbr/\u003eApp.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Overlay Components\"\n    AL[\"Alert\u003cbr/\u003ealert.tsx\"]\n    AD[\"AlertDialog\u003cbr/\u003ealert-dialog.tsx\"]\n    PO[\"Popover\u003cbr/\u003epopover.tsx\"]\n    TS[\"Toast\u003cbr/\u003etoast.tsx\"]\n    TV[\"Toaster\u003cbr/\u003etoaster.tsx\"]\n    SN[\"Sonner Toaster\u003cbr/\u003esonner.tsx\"]\n    TT[\"Tooltip\u003cbr/\u003etooltip.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Hooks\"\n    UT[\"use-toast\u003cbr/\u003euse-toast.ts\"]\n    UM[\"use-mobile\u003cbr/\u003euse-mobile.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Utilities\"\n    CU[\"cn()\u003cbr/\u003eutils.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  AP --\u003e TP\n  AP --\u003e TV\n  AP --\u003e SN\n  TV --\u003e TS\n  UT --\u003e TV\n  UT --\u003e TS\n  TS --\u003e CU\n  AD --\u003e CU\n  PO --\u003e CU\n  TT --\u003e CU\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tooltip.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx#L1-L29)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L1-L112)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Core Components\n- Alert: Status message container with accessible role and semantic title/description parts.\n- AlertDialog: Confirmation dialog with portal rendering, overlay, and animated content.\n- Popover: Contextual overlay with portal rendering and directional animations.\n- Toast/Toaster/Sonner: Notification system with viewport, provider, and global Sonner integration.\n- Tooltip: Helper text overlay with provider and animated content.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [alert.tsx](file://src/components/ui/alert.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [alert-dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [popover.tsx](file://src/components/ui/popover.tsx#L1-L30)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L1-L112)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [tooltip.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx#L1-L29)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe overlay system relies on:\n- Radix UI primitives for accessible semantics and state management.\n- Portal rendering to attach overlays to the document body for correct stacking and layout.\n- Tailwind classes and data attributes for declarative animations.\n- A centralized toast store and provider for global notifications.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Trigger as \"Trigger Element\"\n  participant Provider as \"TooltipProvider\u003cbr/\u003etooltip.tsx\"\n  participant Overlay as \"TooltipContent\u003cbr/\u003etooltip.tsx\"\n  participant Portal as \"Portal Root\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eTrigger: Hover/Focus\n  Trigger-\u003e\u003eProvider: Open state change\n  Provider-\u003e\u003eOverlay: Render with animation classes\n  Overlay-\u003e\u003ePortal: Mount via Portal\n  Overlay--\u003e\u003eUser: Tooltip visible with animation\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tooltip.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx#L1-L29)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Alert\n- Purpose: Present status messages with accessible roles and semantic parts.\n- Accessibility: Uses role=\"alert\" on the container and separate title/description parts for clarity.\n- Variants: Default and destructive variants via class variance authority.\n- Usage: Wrap content with Alert, AlertTitle, and AlertDescription.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class Alert {\n    +role=\"alert\"\n    +variant=\"default|destructive\"\n  }\n  class AlertTitle {\n    +HTMLHeadingElement\n  }\n  class AlertDescription {\n    +HTMLParagraphElement\n  }\n  Alert --\u003e AlertTitle : \"contains\"\n  Alert --\u003e AlertDescription : \"contains\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [alert.tsx](file://src/components/ui/alert.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [alert.tsx](file://src/components/ui/alert.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n### AlertDialog\n- Purpose: Confirmations and destructive actions with modal behavior.\n- Portal rendering: Content is rendered inside a portal to ensure correct stacking.\n- Overlay and animation: Overlay fades in/out;

Sonner allows configuring toast options globally.\n- Smooth animations: Prefer requestAnimationFrame for custom animations; the components rely on Tailwind transitions for efficient rendering.\n- Portal mounting: Rendering overlays via portals avoids expensive reflows in deeply nested DOM trees.\n- Mobile responsiveness: Use responsive breakpoints and viewport positioning; the toast viewport adapts to bottom/right on small screens.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Accessibility and UX Patterns\n- Live regions and screen readers:\n  - Use role=\"alert\" on Alert containers to signal urgent status to assistive technologies.\n  - For Toasts, ensure announcements are handled by the toast library or Sonner; configure aria-live regions if needed.\n- Focus management:\n  - AlertDialog sets focus to actionable elements on open; ensure triggers and actions are keyboard accessible.\n  - Popover and Tooltip should not trap focus; manage focus on open/close to avoid losing context.\n- Escape key dismissal:\n  - AlertDialog and Popover support closing on Escape key via Radix UI defaults.\n- Click-outside closing:\n  - AlertDialog overlay and Popover content can be configured to close when clicking outside.\n- Animations:\n  - All overlays use data-state selectors to animate in/out with fade/slide/zoom transitions.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [alert.tsx](file://src/components/ui/alert.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [alert-dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/alert-dialog.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [popover.tsx](file://src/components/ui/popover.tsx#L1-L30)\n- [tooltip.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx#L1-L29)\n\n## Usage Examples\n- Alert for registration feedback:\n  - Display a status message after form submission using Alert, AlertTitle, and AlertDescription.\n  - Example reference: [alert.tsx](file://src/components/ui/alert.tsx#L1-L44)\n- Toast for language switch confirmation:\n  - Use the global toast API to show a brief confirmation after changing language.\n  - Example reference: [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28), [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [alert.tsx](file://src/components/ui/alert.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Overlays not appearing:\n  - Ensure providers are mounted at the root (TooltipProvider, Toaster, Sonner).\n  - Verify portal rendering is active for dialogs/popovers.\n- Z-index stacking issues:\n  - Dialogs and popovers use high z-index values; adjust if conflicting with custom modals.\n  - Toast viewport uses a high z-index; ensure no parent containers override it.\n- Mobile responsiveness:\n  - Toast viewport positions notifications at the bottom/right on small screens; verify media queries and breakpoints.\n  - Popover alignment and offsets may need adjustment on small devices.\n- Performance:\n  - Limit concurrent toasts to reduce layout thrashing.\n  - Avoid heavy computations during open/close transitions; leverage CSS/Tailwind animations.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L1-L112)\n- [popover.tsx](file://src/components/ui/popover.tsx#L1-L30)\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe overlay components provide a cohesive, accessible, and performant foundation for feedback and contextual information. By leveraging Radix UI primitives, portal rendering, and Tailwind animations, the system ensures predictable behavior across devices and assistive technologies. The toast store and Sonner integration offer scalable notification management, while shared patterns like escape key dismissal and click-outside closing improve usability.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-b7007458-aa6a-441a-9910-e787f0d4653e","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":24099,"completion_tokens":3805,"total_tokens":27904,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
