Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the OrganizersSection component that highlights the event's organizing institutions with detailed information cards.

It covers how the component dynamically renders content based on the current language context, the two-tier structure (Syrian Community card with mission and activity tags, and the Leadership Academy card), visual design elements (logos, decorative Syrian eagle motifs, and hover effects), responsive layout behavior, and guidance for updating content and customizing presentation.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe OrganizersSection is a standalone UI component integrated into the main page layout and driven by the global language context.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Shell\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eProviders: LanguageProvider, QueryClientProvider, TooltipProvider\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Pages\"\n    Index[\"Index.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eRenders all sections\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Sections\"\n    Org[\"OrganizersSection.tsx\"]\n    Hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n    Footer[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Data and Theming\"\n    Lang[\"LanguageContext.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eTranslations and RTL\"]\n    CSS[\"index.css\u003cbr/\u003eCustom colors and utilities\"]\n    TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\u003cbr/\u003eTheme tokens\"]\n    Data[\"eventData.ts\u003cbr/\u003e(organizers data)\"]\n  end\n\n  App --\u003e Index\n  Index --\u003e Hero\n  Index --\u003e Org\n  Index --\u003e Footer\n  Org --\u003e Lang\n  Org --\u003e CSS\n  Org --\u003e TW\n  Org -. \"optional: alternate data source\" .-\u003e Data\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L86-L101)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Core Components\n- OrganizersSection: Renders two organization cards with logos, descriptions, and optional mission statements and activity tags. It selects content based on the current language via the LanguageContext.\n- LanguageContext: Provides the translation function and language state, enabling dynamic content selection and RTL direction.\n- Theme and Utilities: Custom color tokens (including Syrian green) and Tailwind theme extensions enable consistent styling and hover effects.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n- Dynamic content rendering by language\n- Two-tier card layout with Syrian Community and Leadership Academy\n- Visual design with logos and decorative Syrian eagle motifs\n- Responsive layout and hover effects\n- Optional integration with centralized event data\n\n**Section sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe component reads the current language and translation function from the LanguageContext, constructs a language-specific data array, and renders two cards. Styling relies on Tailwind utility classes and custom CSS tokens.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Page as \"Index.tsx\"\n  participant Org as \"OrganizersSection.tsx\"\n  participant Lang as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant CSS as \"index.css\"\n  participant TW as \"tailwind.config.ts\"\n\n  Page-\u003e\u003eOrg: Render section\n  Org-\u003e\u003eLang: useLanguage()\n  Lang--\u003e\u003eOrg: { t, language }\n  Org-\u003e\u003eOrg: Select organizers data by language\n  Org-\u003e\u003eCSS: Apply custom colors and utilities\n  Org-\u003e\u003eTW: Use theme tokens (e.g., syrian.green)\n  Org--\u003e\u003ePage: Render cards with logos and content\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Two-Tier Structure\n- Syrian Community card\n  - Displays organization name, description, and mission statement.\n  - Shows “Work Areas” with a list of activity tags rendered as interactive badges.\n- Leadership Academy card\n  - Displays organization name and description.\n  - Uses a distinct logo and layout.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Render OrganizersSection\"]) --\u003e LangCheck[\"Read language from LanguageContext\"]\n  LangCheck --\u003e BuildData[\"Build language-specific organizers array\"]\n  BuildData --\u003e Card1[\"Render Syrian Community card\"]\n  Card1 --\u003e Mission[\"Show mission statement\"]\n  Card1 --\u003e Activities[\"Show activity tags as badges\"]\n  BuildData --\u003e Card2[\"Render Leadership Academy card\"]\n  Card2 --\u003e Description[\"Show description\"]\n  Activities --\u003e End([\"Complete\"])\n  Description --\u003e End\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n\n### Visual Design and Styling\n- Logos\n  - Syrian Community card uses a dedicated logo asset.\n  - Leadership Academy card uses its own logo asset.\n- Decorative Syrian Eagle Motifs\n  - Background decorative eagles are positioned at top-left and bottom-right corners.\n- Hover Effects\n  - Cards have a subtle elevation and shadow, with a hover effect that changes the border color to a shade of Syrian green.\n  - Activity tags also change background and text color on hover.\n- Typography and Spacing\n  - Titles and descriptions use semantic text colors and spacing utilities.\n- Theme Tokens\n  - Custom tokens define Syrian green and gradients used across the app.\n  - Tailwind theme exposes a “syrian” color palette for consistent usage.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class OrganizersSection {\n    +renders two cards\n    +uses logos and decorative eagles\n    +applies hover effects\n    +responsive layout\n  }\n\n  class LanguageContext {\n    +language: \"ar\"|\"en\"|\"tr\"\n    +t(key): string\n    +isRTL: boolean\n  }\n\n  class Theme {\n    +syrian.red\n    +syrian.green\n    +gradient-hero\n    +gradient-gold\n    +gradient-green\n  }\n\n  OrganizersSection --\u003e LanguageContext : \"consumes\"\n  OrganizersSection --\u003e Theme : \"uses tokens\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n### Responsive Layout Behavior\n- Desktop-first layout\n  - Cards stack vertically with equal spacing.\n  - Within each card, the logo and text align horizontally on medium and up screens.\n- Mobile layout\n  - Cards remain stacked.\n  - Within each card, the logo and text stack vertically for readability.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Viewport[\"Viewport width\"] --\u003e Small{\"Small screen?\"}\n  Small --\u003e|Yes| Stack[\"Stack cards vertically\u003cbr/\u003eStack logo and text\"]\n  Small --\u003e|No| Row[\"Cards side-by-side on wide viewports\"]\n  Row --\u003e Align[\"Within card: logo left, text right (md+)\"]\n  Align --\u003e End([\"Consistent spacing and padding\"])\n  Stack --\u003e End\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L64-L128)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L64-L128)\n\n### Data Sources and Language Integration\n- Language-specific content\n  - The component builds a language-specific array of organizers, selecting appropriate strings for names, descriptions, missions, and activity tags.\n- Translation keys\n  - The section title is pulled from translation keys managed by the LanguageContext.\n- Optional centralized data\n  - The project includes a centralized event data file with an organizers array. While the current component defines its own language arrays, the centralized data could serve as a canonical source for organizers’ information.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Org as \"OrganizersSection.tsx\"\n  participant Lang as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant Data as \"eventData.ts\"\n\n  Org-\u003e\u003eLang: t(\"organizers.title\")\n  Org-\u003e\u003eOrg: Build organizers array by language\n  Org-\u003e\u003eData: Optionally read organizers from eventData\n  Org--\u003e\u003eOrg: Render cards with selected content\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L86-L101)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L86-L101)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Internal dependencies\n  - OrganizersSection depends on LanguageContext for translations and language state.\n  - OrganizersSection imports local assets for logos and decorative eagles.\n  - Tailwind theme and custom CSS tokens are used for colors and utilities.\n- External integrations\n  - The component is included in the main page layout and thus participates in the global provider chain.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Index[\"Index.tsx\"] --\u003e Org[\"OrganizersSection.tsx\"]\n  Org --\u003e Lang[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  Org --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  Org --\u003e TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  Org --\u003e Assets[\"Assets: logos, eagles\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Rendering cost\n  - The component renders a small, fixed number of cards and a few tags. No significant performance concerns are expected.\n- Asset sizes\n  - Ensure logo and decorative asset sizes are optimized to minimize load times.\n- Conditional rendering\n  - The mission and activity tags are only shown when present in the data, avoiding unnecessary DOM nodes.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Content translation consistency\n  - Ensure translation keys for the organizers section title are present in the LanguageContext for all supported languages.\n  - Verify that language-specific arrays include all required fields (names, descriptions, missions, activity tags).\n- Tag rendering for activities\n  - Activity tags are conditionally rendered only if the activities array is present. Confirm that the data includes the activities property for the Syrian Community card.\n- Hover effects not applying\n  - Confirm that the custom color tokens and Tailwind theme are configured and that the component applies the intended hover classes.\n- Decorative assets visibility\n  - Verify that the decorative eagle assets are accessible and sized appropriately for the background overlay.\n- Responsive layout expectations\n  - On small screens, the logo and text stack vertically within each card. If layout appears off, review Tailwind breakpoint classes and container widths.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe OrganizersSection component provides a clean, multilingual presentation of organizing institutions with a two-tier card layout. It leverages the LanguageContext for dynamic content, integrates logos and decorative motifs, and applies responsive design with hover effects. The component is easy to customize and extend, and can be aligned with centralized event data for maintainability.\n\n[No sources needed since this section summarizes without analyzing specific files]\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Updating Organizer Information\n- Add or modify organizations\n  - Extend the language-specific arrays inside the component to include new organizations or update existing entries.\n  - Ensure each organization includes required fields (name, description) and optional fields (mission, activities).\n- Add new languages\n  - Expand the language-specific arrays to include new language variants alongside Arabic, English, and Turkish.\n- Centralized data alignment\n  - If using the centralized event data file, mirror changes to the organizers array there to keep content synchronized.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L86-L101)\n\n### Customizing Visual Presentation\n- Colors and gradients\n  - Adjust custom tokens and Tailwind theme to change the Syrian green or other accent colors.\n- Hover effects\n  - Modify hover classes on cards and tags to adjust border colors or transitions.\n- Layout adjustments\n  - Change spacing utilities and breakpoints to fine-tune the card and text alignment on different screen sizes.\n- Decorative assets\n  - Replace or resize logo and eagle assets to match branding preferences.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L163)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n\n### Related Visual Elements in the Application\n- Hero section and footer also incorporate Syrian eagle and flag imagery, reinforcing thematic consistency.\n- These components demonstrate how decorative assets and color themes are consistently applied across the site.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L103)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-242701b6-1093-4d6f-b583-2619f9f0a326","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":41061,"completion_tokens":3814,"total_tokens":44875,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
