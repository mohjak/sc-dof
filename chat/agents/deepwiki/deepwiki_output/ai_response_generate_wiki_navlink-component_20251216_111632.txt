Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the NavLink component that provides enhanced routing functionality with active state styling. Explain how it wraps React Router's NavLink to support className composition via the cn utility function, enabling dynamic class assignment based on isActive and isPending states. Detail the implementation of the forwardRef pattern to ensure proper DOM ref forwarding and maintain accessibility. Describe the interface extension pattern used in NavLinkCompatProps to preserve React Router's original props while adding support for activeClassName and pendingClassName. Illustrate how this component enables visual feedback for current navigation sections, improving user experience. Include practical usage examples demonstrating custom styling for active links within navigation menus. Address common issues such as broken ref forwarding, incorrect active state propagation, and style conflicts with Tailwind's JIT engine. Provide guidance on extending the component for additional states and integrating with animation libraries.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nNavLink Component\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

User Workflow Mapping\\nCommon user scenarios:\\n1. User visits site → Language selection → Views event information in selected language\\n2. User navigates through event sections using navbar or scrolling\\n3. User views event details (date, time, location) and clicks to view on map\\n4. User explores agenda, speakers, and organizers\\n5. User registers for event through registration section\\n6. User switches languages at any point to view content in preferred language\\n\\nKey entry points:\\n- Main page (Index) as primary entry point\\n- Direct links to specific sections (agenda, speakers, etc.)\\n- Language switcher for immediate language selection\\n\\n13.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\\n3. Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1. Should only include sections that correspond to actual codebase components, services, and implemented features in the project.\\n2. Structure organization should follow project's logical flow and maintain architectural layering.\\n3. Terminology must match project's codebase vocabulary and use consistent naming conventions.\\n4. Include All API documentation to cover all public interfaces and include endpoint specifications.\\n5. In the content, learning progression should start with basic concepts, then progress to advanced topics.\\n6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.\\n7. Include sections for getting Started guide, installation instructions and basic usage examples.\\n8. Provide dedicated sections for each feature, sub-feature, database schema, API and service.\\n9. Content coverage must include all complete features and sub-feature sets.\\n10. Advanced content such as troubleshooting guides and expert-level usage should be included in appropriate place.\\n11. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.\\n12. Reference material should be in logical organization, easy-access patterns.\\n13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.\\n14. If the project is very simple, the document structure should be as simple as possible.\\n15. If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16. The current codebase has 90 valid files, if the number of valid files is less than 50, the document structure can only have one level, and only a brief introduction to the files is provided\\n17. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\nThe final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy. Use the following format:\\n\\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\\n1. You MUST start your response with \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e (opening tag)\\n2. You MUST end your response with \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e (closing tag)\\n3. Do NOT use any other format or tags\\n4. The complete analysis should be wrapped between \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e and \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e tags\\n5.

Document component composition patterns and integration with other UI elements.\\n- children_plan: **Required** Think about how to subdivide the next-level document structure to children or no further splitting is needed. Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

Codebase Deep Dive\\nCritical code modules:\\n- LanguageContext.tsx: Manages multilingual functionality with translation system and RTL support\\n- App.tsx: Root application component with providers for routing, internationalization, and state management\\n- Index.tsx: Main page component that composes all sections\\n- eventData.ts: Central data model for event information\\n- ui/ components: ShadCN UI library components built on Radix UI primitives\\n\\nArchitectural patterns:\\n- Component-based architecture with React\\n- Context API for global state management (language, theme)\\n- Atomic design principles in UI components\\n- Custom hooks for reusable logic (use-mobile, use-toast)\\n- Provider pattern for dependency injection\\n\\n6. Feature Hierarchy/Mapping\\n- Core Application\\n  - Internationalization\\n    - Language switching (ar, en, tr)\\n    - RTL layout support\\n    - Translation system\\n  - Responsive Design\\n    - Mobile detection\\n    - Adaptive layouts\\n  - Navigation\\n    - Navbar with language switcher\\n    - Scroll-to-top functionality\\n  - Event Information\\n    - Hero section\\n    - Countdown timer\\n    - Details section (date, time, location)\\n    - Why section (event purpose)\\n    - Goals section\\n    - Agenda section\\n    - Speakers section\\n    - Organizers section\\n    - Registration section\\n    - Footer\\n\\n7. Beginner-Friendly Guidance\\nConcepts requiring detailed explanation:\\n- React Context API for state management\\n- Internationalization implementation with translation functions\\n- ShadCN UI component library usage\\n- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling approach\\n- Vite build tool configuration\\n- TypeScript interfaces and types\\n\\nPrerequisite knowledge:\\n- Basic React concepts (components, hooks, JSX)\\n- TypeScript fundamentals\\n- CSS and responsive design principles\\n- Understanding of modern JavaScript (ES6+)\\n- Familiarity with npm package management\\n\\n8. Code Structure Analysis\\nCode structure patterns:\\n- Component composition pattern\\n- Context-based state management\\n- Custom hooks for reusable logic\\n- Separation of concerns between UI components and business logic\\n\\nComponent relationships:\\n- App component wraps all providers (QueryClient, LanguageProvider, TooltipProvider)\\n- Index page imports and composes all section components\\n- Section components use UI components from the ui/ directory\\n- LanguageContext provides translation function (t) and language state to all components\\n\\n9. Data Flow Analysis\\nData pathways:\\n- LanguageContext provides language state and translation function to all components\\n- eventData.ts provides event data to components\\n- Translation system flows from LanguageContext to individual components via the t() function\\n- User interactions (language selection) update context state which propagates to all components\\n\\nCritical data models:\\n- LanguageContextType: Defines the structure of the language context\\n- eventData: Central data object containing all event information\\n- Speaker interface: Defines speaker data structure\\n\\n10. Integration and Extension Points Identification\\nExtension mechanisms:\\n- Language system can be extended with additional languages\\n- Event data can be modified or loaded from external sources\\n- UI components can be customized through Tailwind configuration\\n- Theme can be extended with additional color schemes\\n\\nIntegration points:\\n- Google Maps integration for venue location\\n- Potential registration system integration\\n- Social media sharing capabilities\\n- Analytics integration\\n\\n11. Dependency Analysis\\nExternal dependencies:\\n- React and React DOM: Core UI library\\n- Vite: Build tool and development server\\n- Tailwind CSS: Styling framework\\n- ShadCN UI: Component library built on Radix UI\\n- React Router DOM: Client-side routing\\n- React Query: Data fetching and caching\\n- date-fns: Date manipulation utilities\\n- lucide-react: Icon library\\n\\nInternal component interdependencies:\\n- App depends on all section components and providers\\n- Section components depend on UI components and hooks\\n- UI components depend on utility functions (cn)\\n- All components depend on LanguageContext for translations\\n\\n12. User Workflow Mapping\\nCommon user scenarios:\\n1. User visits site → Language selection → Views event information in selected language\\n2. User navigates through event sections using navbar or scrolling\\n3. User views event details (date, time, location) and clicks to view on map\\n4. User explores agenda, speakers, and organizers\\n5. User registers for event through registration section\\n6. User switches languages at any point to view content in preferred language\\n\\nKey entry points:\\n- Main page (Index) as primary entry point\\n- Direct links to specific sections (agenda, speakers, etc.)\\n- Language switcher for immediate language selection\\n\\n13.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\\n3. Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1. Should only include sections that correspond to actual codebase components, services, and implemented features in the project.\\n2. Structure organization should follow project's logical flow and maintain architectural layering.\\n3. Terminology must match project's codebase vocabulary and use consistent naming conventions.\\n4. Include All API documentation to cover all public interfaces and include endpoint specifications.\\n5. In the content, learning progression should start with basic concepts, then progress to advanced topics.\\n6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.\\n7. Include sections for getting Started guide, installation instructions and basic usage examples.\\n8. Provide dedicated sections for each feature, sub-feature, database schema, API and service.\\n9. Content coverage must include all complete features and sub-feature sets.\\n10. Advanced content such as troubleshooting guides and expert-level usage should be included in appropriate place.\\n11. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.\\n12. Reference material should be in logical organization, easy-access patterns.\\n13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.\\n14. If the project is very simple, the document structure should be as simple as possible.\\n15. If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16. The current codebase has 90 valid files, if the number of valid files is less than 50, the document structure can only have one level, and only a brief introduction to the files is provided\\n17. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\nThe final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy. Use the following format:\\n\\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\\n1. You MUST start your response with \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e (opening tag)\\n2. You MUST end your response with \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e (closing tag)\\n3. Do NOT use any other format or tags\\n4. The complete analysis should be wrapped between \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e and \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e tags\\n5.

Code Structure Analysis\\nCode structure patterns:\\n- Component composition pattern\\n- Context-based state management\\n- Custom hooks for reusable logic\\n- Separation of concerns between UI components and business logic\\n\\nComponent relationships:\\n- App component wraps all providers (QueryClient, LanguageProvider, TooltipProvider)\\n- Index page imports and composes all section components\\n- Section components use UI components from the ui/ directory\\n- LanguageContext provides translation function (t) and language state to all components\\n\\n9. Data Flow Analysis\\nData pathways:\\n- LanguageContext provides language state and translation function to all components\\n- eventData.ts provides event data to components\\n- Translation system flows from LanguageContext to individual components via the t() function\\n- User interactions (language selection) update context state which propagates to all components\\n\\nCritical data models:\\n- LanguageContextType: Defines the structure of the language context\\n- eventData: Central data object containing all event information\\n- Speaker interface: Defines speaker data structure\\n\\n10. Integration and Extension Points Identification\\nExtension mechanisms:\\n- Language system can be extended with additional languages\\n- Event data can be modified or loaded from external sources\\n- UI components can be customized through Tailwind configuration\\n- Theme can be extended with additional color schemes\\n\\nIntegration points:\\n- Google Maps integration for venue location\\n- Potential registration system integration\\n- Social media sharing capabilities\\n- Analytics integration\\n\\n11. Dependency Analysis\\nExternal dependencies:\\n- React and React DOM: Core UI library\\n- Vite: Build tool and development server\\n- Tailwind CSS: Styling framework\\n- ShadCN UI: Component library built on Radix UI\\n- React Router DOM: Client-side routing\\n- React Query: Data fetching and caching\\n- date-fns: Date manipulation utilities\\n- lucide-react: Icon library\\n\\nInternal component interdependencies:\\n- App depends on all section components and providers\\n- Section components depend on UI components and hooks\\n- UI components depend on utility functions (cn)\\n- All components depend on LanguageContext for translations\\n\\n12. User Workflow Mapping\\nCommon user scenarios:\\n1. User visits site → Language selection → Views event information in selected language\\n2. User navigates through event sections using navbar or scrolling\\n3. User views event details (date, time, location) and clicks to view on map\\n4. User explores agenda, speakers, and organizers\\n5. User registers for event through registration section\\n6. User switches languages at any point to view content in preferred language\\n\\nKey entry points:\\n- Main page (Index) as primary entry point\\n- Direct links to specific sections (agenda, speakers, etc.)\\n- Language switcher for immediate language selection\\n\\n13.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\\n3. Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1. Should only include sections that correspond to actual codebase components, services, and implemented features in the project.\\n2. Structure organization should follow project's logical flow and maintain architectural layering.\\n3. Terminology must match project's codebase vocabulary and use consistent naming conventions.\\n4. Include All API documentation to cover all public interfaces and include endpoint specifications.\\n5. In the content, learning progression should start with basic concepts, then progress to advanced topics.\\n6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.\\n7. Include sections for getting Started guide, installation instructions and basic usage examples.\\n8. Provide dedicated sections for each feature, sub-feature, database schema, API and service.\\n9. Content coverage must include all complete features and sub-feature sets.\\n10. Advanced content such as troubleshooting guides and expert-level usage should be included in appropriate place.\\n11. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.\\n12. Reference material should be in logical organization, easy-access patterns.\\n13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.\\n14. If the project is very simple, the document structure should be as simple as possible.\\n15. If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16. The current codebase has 90 valid files, if the number of valid files is less than 50, the document structure can only have one level, and only a brief introduction to the files is provided\\n17. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\nThe final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy. Use the following format:\\n\\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\\n1. You MUST start your response with \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e (opening tag)\\n2. You MUST end your response with \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e (closing tag)\\n3. Do NOT use any other format or tags\\n4. The complete analysis should be wrapped between \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e and \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e tags\\n5.

Include style customization options and theming support. Address cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization. Document component composition patterns and integration with other UI elements.\\n- children_plan: **Required** Think about how to subdivide the next-level document structure to children or no further splitting is needed. Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\\n3. Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1.

Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

User Workflow Mapping\\nCommon user scenarios:\\n1. User visits site → Language selection → Views event information in selected language\\n2. User navigates through event sections using navbar or scrolling\\n3. User views event details (date, time, location) and clicks to view on map\\n4. User explores agenda, speakers, and organizers\\n5. User registers for event through registration section\\n6. User switches languages at any point to view content in preferred language\\n\\nKey entry points:\\n- Main page (Index) as primary entry point\\n- Direct links to specific sections (agenda, speakers, etc.)\\n- Language switcher for immediate language selection\\n\\n13.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\\n3. Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1. Should only include sections that correspond to actual codebase components, services, and implemented features in the project.\\n2. Structure organization should follow project's logical flow and maintain architectural layering.\\n3. Terminology must match project's codebase vocabulary and use consistent naming conventions.\\n4. Include All API documentation to cover all public interfaces and include endpoint specifications.\\n5. In the content, learning progression should start with basic concepts, then progress to advanced topics.\\n6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.\\n7. Include sections for getting Started guide, installation instructions and basic usage examples.\\n8. Provide dedicated sections for each feature, sub-feature, database schema, API and service.\\n9. Content coverage must include all complete features and sub-feature sets.\\n10. Advanced content such as troubleshooting guides and expert-level usage should be included in appropriate place.\\n11. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.\\n12. Reference material should be in logical organization, easy-access patterns.\\n13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.\\n14. If the project is very simple, the document structure should be as simple as possible.\\n15. If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16. The current codebase has 90 valid files, if the number of valid files is less than 50, the document structure can only have one level, and only a brief introduction to the files is provided\\n17. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\nThe final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy. Use the following format:\\n\\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\\n1. You MUST start your response with \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e (opening tag)\\n2. You MUST end your response with \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e (closing tag)\\n3. Do NOT use any other format or tags\\n4. The complete analysis should be wrapped between \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e and \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e tags\\n5. The prompt MUST be as detailed as possible, specifying what content needs to be included and detailed guidance on the structure of the content\\n\\n**JSON Structure Fields:**\\n- title: **Required** section-identifier\\n- name: **Required** Section name\\n- dependent_file: **Required** List of dependent files for chapter information, It is a relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\\n- prompt: **Required**\\n    - For the summary section or root layer: Create comprehensive content for this section focused on [SPECIFIC PROJECT COMPONENT/FEATURE].

Include style customization options and theming support. Address cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization. Document component composition patterns and integration with other UI elements.\\n- children_plan: **Required** Think about how to subdivide the next-level document structure to children or no further splitting is needed. Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1. Should only include sections that correspond to actual codebase components, services, and implemented features in the project.\\n2. Structure organization should follow project's logical flow and maintain architectural layering.\\n3. Terminology must match project's codebase vocabulary and use consistent naming conventions.\\n4. Include All API documentation to cover all public interfaces and include endpoint specifications.\\n5. In the content, learning progression should start with basic concepts, then progress to advanced topics.\\n6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.\\n7. Include sections for getting Started guide, installation instructions and basic usage examples.\\n8. Provide dedicated sections for each feature, sub-feature, database schema, API and service.\\n9. Content coverage must include all complete features and sub-feature sets.\\n10. Advanced content such as troubleshooting guides and expert-level usage should be included in appropriate place.\\n11. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.\\n12. Reference material should be in logical organization, easy-access patterns.\\n13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.\\n14. If the project is very simple, the document structure should be as simple as possible.\\n15. If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16.

Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

Repository Type Detection\\nThe repository is a Frontend Application. It is a React-based web application with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application is designed as a multilingual event platform for the Syrian community, featuring responsive design and internationalization support.\\n\\n2. Codebase Overview/Analysis\\n- Core functionality: A multilingual event website for the Syrian community with event details, agenda, speakers, registration, and organizational information.\\n- Primary use cases: Displaying event information in Arabic, English, and Turkish with RTL support for Arabic.\\n- Primary programming languages: TypeScript, JSX, CSS (via Tailwind)\\n- Critical frameworks and library dependencies:\\n  - React 18 with TypeScript\\n  - Vite as build tool\\n  - Tailwind CSS for styling\\n  - ShadCN UI components built on Radix UI primitives\\n  - React Router DOM for routing\\n  - React Query for data management\\n  - date-fns for date manipulation\\n\\n3. Project Directory Architecture Mapping/Analysis\\n- src/: Main source code directory\\n  - components/: Reusable UI components including ShadCN UI library components and custom application components\\n  - data/: Event data and content\\n  - hooks/: Custom React hooks\\n  - lib/: Utility functions\\n  - pages/: Application pages\\n- public/: Static assets and manifest files\\n- Configuration files:\\n  - package.json: Project metadata and dependencies\\n  - vite.config.ts: Vite build configuration\\n  - tailwind.config.ts: Tailwind CSS customization\\n  - tsconfig.json: TypeScript configuration\\n  - eslint.config.js: ESLint configuration\\n\\n4. Core Functionality and Services Identification\\nPrincipal features:\\n- Multilingual support (Arabic, English, Turkish) with RTL layout for Arabic\\n- Event information display (date, time, location)\\n- Agenda section with event schedule\\n- Speakers section with participant information\\n- Goals and purpose of the event\\n- Organizers information\\n- Registration section\\n- Responsive design with mobile support\\n- Internationalization system with language context\\n\\n5. Codebase Deep Dive\\nCritical code modules:\\n- LanguageContext.tsx: Manages multilingual functionality with translation system and RTL support\\n- App.tsx: Root application component with providers for routing, internationalization, and state management\\n- Index.tsx: Main page component that composes all sections\\n- eventData.ts: Central data model for event information\\n- ui/ components: ShadCN UI library components built on Radix UI primitives\\n\\nArchitectural patterns:\\n- Component-based architecture with React\\n- Context API for global state management (language, theme)\\n- Atomic design principles in UI components\\n- Custom hooks for reusable logic (use-mobile, use-toast)\\n- Provider pattern for dependency injection\\n\\n6. Feature Hierarchy/Mapping\\n- Core Application\\n  - Internationalization\\n    - Language switching (ar, en, tr)\\n    - RTL layout support\\n    - Translation system\\n  - Responsive Design\\n    - Mobile detection\\n    - Adaptive layouts\\n  - Navigation\\n    - Navbar with language switcher\\n    - Scroll-to-top functionality\\n  - Event Information\\n    - Hero section\\n    - Countdown timer\\n    - Details section (date, time, location)\\n    - Why section (event purpose)\\n    - Goals section\\n    - Agenda section\\n    - Speakers section\\n    - Organizers section\\n    - Registration section\\n    - Footer\\n\\n7. Beginner-Friendly Guidance\\nConcepts requiring detailed explanation:\\n- React Context API for state management\\n- Internationalization implementation with translation functions\\n- ShadCN UI component library usage\\n- Tailwind CSS utility-first styling approach\\n- Vite build tool configuration\\n- TypeScript interfaces and types\\n\\nPrerequisite knowledge:\\n- Basic React concepts (components, hooks, JSX)\\n- TypeScript fundamentals\\n- CSS and responsive design principles\\n- Understanding of modern JavaScript (ES6+)\\n- Familiarity with npm package management\\n\\n8. Code Structure Analysis\\nCode structure patterns:\\n- Component composition pattern\\n- Context-based state management\\n- Custom hooks for reusable logic\\n- Separation of concerns between UI components and business logic\\n\\nComponent relationships:\\n- App component wraps all providers (QueryClient, LanguageProvider, TooltipProvider)\\n- Index page imports and composes all section components\\n- Section components use UI components from the ui/ directory\\n- LanguageContext provides translation function (t) and language state to all components\\n\\n9. Data Flow Analysis\\nData pathways:\\n- LanguageContext provides language state and translation function to all components\\n- eventData.ts provides event data to components\\n- Translation system flows from LanguageContext to individual components via the t() function\\n- User interactions (language selection) update context state which propagates to all components\\n\\nCritical data models:\\n- LanguageContextType: Defines the structure of the language context\\n- eventData: Central data object containing all event information\\n- Speaker interface: Defines speaker data structure\\n\\n10. Integration and Extension Points Identification\\nExtension mechanisms:\\n- Language system can be extended with additional languages\\n- Event data can be modified or loaded from external sources\\n- UI components can be customized through Tailwind configuration\\n- Theme can be extended with additional color schemes\\n\\nIntegration points:\\n- Google Maps integration for venue location\\n- Potential registration system integration\\n- Social media sharing capabilities\\n- Analytics integration\\n\\n11. Dependency Analysis\\nExternal dependencies:\\n- React and React DOM: Core UI library\\n- Vite: Build tool and development server\\n- Tailwind CSS: Styling framework\\n- ShadCN UI: Component library built on Radix UI\\n- React Router DOM: Client-side routing\\n- React Query: Data fetching and caching\\n- date-fns: Date manipulation utilities\\n- lucide-react: Icon library\\n\\nInternal component interdependencies:\\n- App depends on all section components and providers\\n- Section components depend on UI components and hooks\\n- UI components depend on utility functions (cn)\\n- All components depend on LanguageContext for translations\\n\\n12. User Workflow Mapping\\nCommon user scenarios:\\n1. User visits site → Language selection → Views event information in selected language\\n2. User navigates through event sections using navbar or scrolling\\n3. User views event details (date, time, location) and clicks to view on map\\n4. User explores agenda, speakers, and organizers\\n5. User registers for event through registration section\\n6. User switches languages at any point to view content in preferred language\\n\\nKey entry points:\\n- Main page (Index) as primary entry point\\n- Direct links to specific sections (agenda, speakers, etc.)\\n- Language switcher for immediate language selection\\n\\n13.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\\n3. Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1. Should only include sections that correspond to actual codebase components, services, and implemented features in the project.\\n2. Structure organization should follow project's logical flow and maintain architectural layering.\\n3. Terminology must match project's codebase vocabulary and use consistent naming conventions.\\n4. Include All API documentation to cover all public interfaces and include endpoint specifications.\\n5. In the content, learning progression should start with basic concepts, then progress to advanced topics.\\n6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.\\n7. Include sections for getting Started guide, installation instructions and basic usage examples.\\n8. Provide dedicated sections for each feature, sub-feature, database schema, API and service.\\n9. Content coverage must include all complete features and sub-feature sets.\\n10. Advanced content such as troubleshooting guides and expert-level usage should be included in appropriate place.\\n11. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.\\n12. Reference material should be in logical organization, easy-access patterns.\\n13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.\\n14. If the project is very simple, the document structure should be as simple as possible.\\n15. If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16. The current codebase has 90 valid files, if the number of valid files is less than 50, the document structure can only have one level, and only a brief introduction to the files is provided\\n17. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\nThe final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy.

Code Structure Analysis\\nCode structure patterns:\\n- Component composition pattern\\n- Context-based state management\\n- Custom hooks for reusable logic\\n- Separation of concerns between UI components and business logic\\n\\nComponent relationships:\\n- App component wraps all providers (QueryClient, LanguageProvider, TooltipProvider)\\n- Index page imports and composes all section components\\n- Section components use UI components from the ui/ directory\\n- LanguageContext provides translation function (t) and language state to all components\\n\\n9. Data Flow Analysis\\nData pathways:\\n- LanguageContext provides language state and translation function to all components\\n- eventData.ts provides event data to components\\n- Translation system flows from LanguageContext to individual components via the t() function\\n- User interactions (language selection) update context state which propagates to all components\\n\\nCritical data models:\\n- LanguageContextType: Defines the structure of the language context\\n- eventData: Central data object containing all event information\\n- Speaker interface: Defines speaker data structure\\n\\n10. Integration and Extension Points Identification\\nExtension mechanisms:\\n- Language system can be extended with additional languages\\n- Event data can be modified or loaded from external sources\\n- UI components can be customized through Tailwind configuration\\n- Theme can be extended with additional color schemes\\n\\nIntegration points:\\n- Google Maps integration for venue location\\n- Potential registration system integration\\n- Social media sharing capabilities\\n- Analytics integration\\n\\n11. Dependency Analysis\\nExternal dependencies:\\n- React and React DOM: Core UI library\\n- Vite: Build tool and development server\\n- Tailwind CSS: Styling framework\\n- ShadCN UI: Component library built on Radix UI\\n- React Router DOM: Client-side routing\\n- React Query: Data fetching and caching\\n- date-fns: Date manipulation utilities\\n- lucide-react: Icon library\\n\\nInternal component interdependencies:\\n- App depends on all section components and providers\\n- Section components depend on UI components and hooks\\n- UI components depend on utility functions (cn)\\n- All components depend on LanguageContext for translations\\n\\n12. User Workflow Mapping\\nCommon user scenarios:\\n1. User visits site → Language selection → Views event information in selected language\\n2. User navigates through event sections using navbar or scrolling\\n3. User views event details (date, time, location) and clicks to view on map\\n4. User explores agenda, speakers, and organizers\\n5. User registers for event through registration section\\n6. User switches languages at any point to view content in preferred language\\n\\nKey entry points:\\n- Main page (Index) as primary entry point\\n- Direct links to specific sections (agenda, speakers, etc.)\\n- Language switcher for immediate language selection\\n\\n13.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\\n3. Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1. Should only include sections that correspond to actual codebase components, services, and implemented features in the project.\\n2. Structure organization should follow project's logical flow and maintain architectural layering.\\n3. Terminology must match project's codebase vocabulary and use consistent naming conventions.\\n4. Include All API documentation to cover all public interfaces and include endpoint specifications.\\n5. In the content, learning progression should start with basic concepts, then progress to advanced topics.\\n6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.\\n7. Include sections for getting Started guide, installation instructions and basic usage examples.\\n8. Provide dedicated sections for each feature, sub-feature, database schema, API and service.\\n9. Content coverage must include all complete features and sub-feature sets.\\n10. Advanced content such as troubleshooting guides and expert-level usage should be included in appropriate place.\\n11. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.\\n12. Reference material should be in logical organization, easy-access patterns.\\n13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.\\n14. If the project is very simple, the document structure should be as simple as possible.\\n15. If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16. The current codebase has 90 valid files, if the number of valid files is less than 50, the document structure can only have one level, and only a brief introduction to the files is provided\\n17. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\nThe final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy. Use the following format:\\n\\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\\n1. You MUST start your response with \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e (opening tag)\\n2. You MUST end your response with \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e (closing tag)\\n3. Do NOT use any other format or tags\\n4. The complete analysis should be wrapped between \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e and \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e tags\\n5.

Include style customization options and theming support. Address cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization. Document component composition patterns and integration with other UI elements.\\n- children_plan: **Required** Think about how to subdivide the next-level document structure to children or no further splitting is needed. Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

Dependency Analysis\\nExternal dependencies:\\n- React and React DOM: Core UI library\\n- Vite: Build tool and development server\\n- Tailwind CSS: Styling framework\\n- ShadCN UI: Component library built on Radix UI\\n- React Router DOM: Client-side routing\\n- React Query: Data fetching and caching\\n- date-fns: Date manipulation utilities\\n- lucide-react: Icon library\\n\\nInternal component interdependencies:\\n- App depends on all section components and providers\\n- Section components depend on UI components and hooks\\n- UI components depend on utility functions (cn)\\n- All components depend on LanguageContext for translations\\n\\n12. User Workflow Mapping\\nCommon user scenarios:\\n1. User visits site → Language selection → Views event information in selected language\\n2. User navigates through event sections using navbar or scrolling\\n3. User views event details (date, time, location) and clicks to view on map\\n4. User explores agenda, speakers, and organizers\\n5. User registers for event through registration section\\n6. User switches languages at any point to view content in preferred language\\n\\nKey entry points:\\n- Main page (Index) as primary entry point\\n- Direct links to specific sections (agenda, speakers, etc.)\\n- Language switcher for immediate language selection\\n\\n13.

Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

It demonstrates how the component composes Tailwind classes using the cn utility, preserves React Router’s original props, and supports additional props for active and pending states. The document also covers ref forwarding, common pitfalls, and best practices for styling and integration.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe NavLink component resides in the components folder alongside other UI and page-level components. It integrates with the application’s routing setup and Tailwind configuration to deliver consistent, accessible navigation with dynamic active-state styling.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application\"\n    A[\"App.tsx\"]\n    B[\"Index.tsx\"]\n    C[\"NavLink.tsx\"]\n    D[\"utils.ts (cn)\"]\n    E[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  A --\u003e B\n  B --\u003e C\n  C --\u003e D\n  D --\u003e E\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Core Components\n- NavLink: A thin wrapper around React Router’s NavLink that adds className composition via cn and supports activeClassName and pendingClassName for dynamic styling based on isActive and isPending states.\n- cn utility: A Tailwind-merge-enabled function that merges class names safely, resolving conflicts and ensuring predictable styles.\n- Tailwind configuration: Extends the design system with custom colors, fonts, and animations, enabling consistent styling across the app.\n\nKey implementation highlights:\n- Props extension: NavLinkCompatProps extends NavLinkProps while allowing className, activeClassName, and pendingClassName.\n- Active state composition: Uses the function-as-children pattern to compute className dynamically.\n- Ref forwarding: forwardRef ensures DOM refs are passed through to the underlying anchor element.\n- Accessibility: Inherits native anchor semantics and supports aria attributes via props.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe NavLink component sits between the application’s routing layer and the UI styling layer. It receives routing props from React Router, computes active/pending classes via cn, and renders a native anchor element with proper ref forwarding.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Router as \"React Router\"\n  participant NavLink as \"NavLink\"\n  participant Utils as \"cn (utils.ts)\"\n  participant DOM as \"HTMLAnchorElement\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eRouter: Click navigation link\n  Router-\u003e\u003eNavLink: Render with to, className, activeClassName, pendingClassName\n  NavLink-\u003e\u003eUtils: Compute merged classes (className + isActive + isPending)\n  Utils--\u003e\u003eNavLink: Merged className string\n  NavLink-\u003e\u003eDOM: Render anchor with computed className and forwarded ref\n  DOM--\u003e\u003eUser: Updated active state styling\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### NavLink Component\nPurpose:\n- Enhance React Router’s NavLink with className composition and explicit active/pending styling hooks.\n- Preserve all original NavLinkProps while adding activeClassName and pendingClassName.\n- Ensure DOM ref forwarding for imperative access and accessibility.\n\nImplementation patterns:\n- Interface extension: NavLinkCompatProps omits the original className from NavLinkProps and adds optional activeClassName and pendingClassName.\n- Function-as-children: The className prop accepts a function receiving isActive and isPending booleans to compute the final class string.\n- Ref forwarding: forwardRef passes the ref to the underlying RouterNavLink, enabling imperative focus, scroll, or analytics integration.\n\nAccessibility and UX:\n- Inherits anchor semantics and supports aria attributes via props.\n- Provides visual feedback for current route and pending navigation states.\n\nExtensibility:\n- Additional states can be supported by extending the className function to incorporate more conditions.\n- Integrating with animation libraries is straightforward by adding transition classes or wrappers.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class NavLinkCompatProps {\n    +string? className\n    +string? activeClassName\n    +string? pendingClassName\n  }\n\n  class NavLink {\n    +forwardRef\u003cHTMLAnchorElement, NavLinkCompatProps\u003e()\n    +renders RouterNavLink\n    +uses cn for className composition\n  }\n\n  class Utils_cn {\n    +cn(...inputs) string\n  }\n\n  NavLink --\u003e NavLinkCompatProps : \"accepts\"\n  NavLink --\u003e Utils_cn : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n### Practical Usage Examples\n- Active link styling in navigation menus:\n  - Provide activeClassName to highlight the current route.\n  - Combine with pendingClassName to indicate navigation in progress.\n- Conditional class composition:\n  - Use className to apply base styles and merge with active/pending classes via cn.\n- Accessibility:\n  - Ensure aria-current is set appropriately if needed, or rely on the underlying anchor semantics.\n\nNote: Specific code examples are referenced by file path and line ranges rather than pasted content.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n- Broken ref forwarding:\n  - Symptom: Cannot programmatically focus or manipulate the anchor element.\n  - Cause: Not using forwardRef or not passing ref to the underlying element.\n  - Fix: Ensure forwardRef is used and ref is passed to RouterNavLink.\n- Incorrect active state propagation:\n  - Symptom: Active class not applied or flickers during navigation.\n  - Causes: Conflicting styles, incorrect className composition, or route mismatch.\n  - Fixes: Verify activeClassName/pendingClassName precedence, ensure to prop matches route, and confirm cn merges classes correctly.\n- Style conflicts with Tailwind’s JIT engine:\n  - Symptom: Active classes not generated or purged.\n  - Causes: Dynamic class names not statically analyzable by Tailwind.\n  - Fixes: Use static class names for active/pending states or configure content globs to include dynamic usage.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nNavLink depends on:\n- React Router’s NavLink and NavLinkProps for routing behavior.\n- cn utility for safe class name merging.\n- Tailwind CSS for styling and JIT processing.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  RR[\"react-router-dom (NavLink, NavLinkProps)\"] --\u003e NLC[\"NavLink.tsx\"]\n  UT[\"src/lib/utils.ts (cn)\"] --\u003e NLC\n  TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"] --\u003e NLC\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Minimize re-renders by avoiding inline function creation for className when props are static.\n- Prefer static class names for active/pending states to improve Tailwind’s static analysis and reduce bundle size.\n- Use forwardRef judiciously; only when imperative DOM access is required.\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Active class not applying:\n  - Verify activeClassName and pendingClassName are provided and not empty.\n  - Confirm the to prop matches the current route.\n- Styles not taking effect:\n  - Check cn precedence and ensure className is not overriding active/pending classes unintentionally.\n  - Inspect Tailwind’s content globs to ensure dynamic class names are included.\n- Accessibility issues:\n  - Ensure the component remains an anchor element and retains focus management if needed.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe NavLink component provides a clean, extensible way to style active and pending navigation states while preserving React Router’s routing behavior and accessibility. By leveraging cn for class composition and forwardRef for DOM access, it integrates seamlessly with Tailwind CSS and the broader application architecture. Following the best practices and troubleshooting guidance outlined here will help ensure reliable, accessible navigation across all user contexts.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-01ccce23-b4a4-4582-b6bd-c8f892a1fce3","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":113858,"completion_tokens":2314,"total_tokens":116172,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
