Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the component reference focused on documenting all reusable UI components in the application.

The component library consists of two main categories: custom application components designed specifically for this event website, and ShadCN UI components built on Radix UI primitives that provide accessible, styled building blocks. All components follow a consistent design system with support for multiple languages (Arabic, English, Turkish) and responsive layouts across device sizes.\n\n## Custom Application Components\n\n### HeroSection\nThe HeroSection component serves as the main landing page header, featuring a full-screen background with event branding, countdown timer, and call-to-action. It displays the Syrian eagle emblem, national flag, and multilingual event information with animated elements.\n\n**Visual Appearance**: The component features a hero image background with gradient overlay, decorative confetti animation, centered content with event title, subtitle, tagline, and date information. The Syrian eagle and flag are prominently displayed with subtle animations.\n\n**Behavior**: The component is static but includes CSS animations for fade-in effects on page load. It automatically adapts to the current language context for all text content.\n\n**Accessibility Features**: All images include appropriate alt text in Arabic, and the component follows semantic HTML structure with proper heading hierarchy.\n\n**Responsive Design**: The component adjusts font sizes and spacing across breakpoints, with optimized layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n\n### CountdownTimer\nThe CountdownTimer component displays a real-time countdown to the event date with days, hours, minutes, and seconds. It updates every second and supports multilingual labels for time units.\n\n**Props**: This component has no configurable props. It uses the `useLanguage` hook to determine the current language and display appropriate time unit labels.\n\n**Events**: The component automatically updates the displayed time every second through an interval timer managed with useEffect.\n\n**Usage Patterns**: The component is designed to be used as a standalone element within other sections. It automatically calculates time remaining until December 20, 2025, at 18:00.\n\n**Visual Appearance**: Time units are displayed in individual glass-morphism cards with subtle hover effects and background glow. Each unit shows a two-digit value with leading zero if necessary.\n\n**Accessibility Features**: The component uses semantic HTML and ensures sufficient color contrast. Screen readers will announce the updated time values as they change.\n\n**Performance Considerations**: The component efficiently manages the interval timer, cleaning it up on unmount to prevent memory leaks.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n\n### RegistrationSection\nThe RegistrationSection component provides event registration functionality through a QR code and button link. It features a prominent design with visual emphasis on the registration action.\n\n**Props**: This component has no configurable props. It uses the `useLanguage` hook to determine the current language and display appropriate text content.\n\n**Events**: The component includes a button that opens the registration form in a new tab when clicked. The QR code can be scanned to access the same form.\n\n**Usage Patterns**: The component should be placed in a prominent location on the page, typically after the main event information sections.\n\n**Visual Appearance**: The component features a card with corner decorations, containing a QR code with glow effect and a call-to-action button with hover animation. Decorative elements in Syrian green create visual interest.\n\n**Accessibility Features**: The button includes proper focus states and keyboard navigation support. The QR code is contained within a descriptive card with appropriate text alternatives.\n\n**Responsive Design**: The component adjusts the size of the QR code and button across breakpoints, ensuring usability on all device sizes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n## ShadCN UI Components\n\n### Button\nThe Button component is a versatile interactive element with multiple variants and sizes, built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling.\n\n**Props**:\n- `variant`: \"default\" | \"destructive\" | \"outline\" | \"secondary\" | \"ghost\" | \"link\" (default: \"default\")\n- `size`: \"default\" | \"sm\" | \"lg\" | \"icon\" (default: \"default\")\n- `asChild`: boolean (default: false)\n- Inherits all standard HTML button attributes\n\n**Events**: Standard button events (onClick, onMouseEnter, etc.) are supported through spread props.\n\n**Usage Patterns**: Use the Button component for all interactive actions. The `asChild` prop allows rendering the button styles on other elements like anchors.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Button {\n        +variant: string\n        +size: string\n        +asChild: boolean\n        +className: string\n        +ref: Ref\n        +props: any\n    }\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n### Card\nThe Card component provides a container for grouping related content with a consistent visual style, including header, title, description, content, and footer sections.\n\n**Composition**: The Card component is composed of several sub-components:\n- Card: The main container\n- CardHeader: Top section containing title and description\n- CardTitle: Main heading\n- CardDescription: Supporting text\n- CardContent: Main content area\n- CardFooter: Bottom section for actions\n\n**Props**: Each sub-component accepts standard HTML div attributes through the className and ...props spread.\n\n**Usage Patterns**: Use Card to organize content into distinct sections. Combine sub-components as needed for different layouts.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Card {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class CardHeader {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class CardTitle {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class CardDescription {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class CardContent {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class CardFooter {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    Card *-- CardHeader\n    Card *-- CardContent\n    Card *-- CardFooter\n    CardHeader *-- CardTitle\n    CardHeader *-- CardDescription\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n### Dialog\nThe Dialog component provides a modal interface for displaying content that requires user attention, built on Radix UI's dialog primitive with enhanced styling.\n\n**Composition**: The Dialog system includes:\n- Dialog: Root component\n- DialogTrigger: Opens the dialog\n- DialogPortal: Renders content in a portal\n- DialogOverlay: Background overlay\n- DialogContent: Main dialog container\n- DialogHeader: Header section\n- DialogFooter: Footer section\n- DialogTitle: Title element\n- DialogDescription: Description text\n- DialogClose: Close button\n\n**Props**: Each component accepts standard HTML attributes appropriate to its element type.\n\n**Events**: The component handles open/close state management and provides a close button with proper accessibility semantics.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Dialog {\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogTrigger {\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogPortal {\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogOverlay {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogContent {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogHeader {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogFooter {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogTitle {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogDescription {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    class DialogClose {\n        +className: string\n        +props: any\n    }\n    Dialog *-- DialogTrigger\n    Dialog *-- DialogPortal\n    DialogPortal *-- DialogOverlay\n    DialogPortal *-- DialogContent\n    DialogContent *-- DialogHeader\n    DialogContent *-- DialogFooter\n    DialogHeader *-- DialogTitle\n    DialogHeader *-- DialogDescription\n    DialogContent *-- DialogClose\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n\n### Form\nThe Form component provides a comprehensive form handling system built on react-hook-form with accessible styling and validation support.\n\n**Composition**: The Form system includes:\n- Form: FormProvider wrapper\n- FormField: Controller wrapper for form fields\n- FormItem: Container for form elements\n- FormLabel: Accessible label\n- FormControl: Controlled input element\n- FormDescription: Helper text\n- FormMessage: Validation error message\n\n**Props**: The system uses React context to manage form state, with each component receiving appropriate props for its role.\n\n**Usage Patterns**: Wrap forms with the Form component and use FormField for each input.

Tab order is logical and consistent.\n\n**Screen Reader Support**: Components use appropriate ARIA attributes, semantic HTML elements, and accessible labels. Dynamic content updates are announced to screen readers.\n\n**Color Contrast**: The theme ensures sufficient color contrast between text and background colors, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards.\n\n**Focus Indicators**: All interactive elements have visible focus states that meet accessibility requirements.\n\n**Language Support**: The application supports multiple languages with proper dir attribute handling for RTL (Arabic) and LTR (English, Turkish) layouts.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L130)\n\n## Responsive Design Guidelines\nThe component library is designed to be fully responsive across all device sizes with consistent behavior and appearance.\n\n**Breakpoints**: The application uses standard Tailwind CSS breakpoints:\n- Mobile: up to 640px\n- Tablet: 640px to 1024px\n- Desktop: 1024px and above\n\n**Layout Adaptation**: Components adjust their layout, spacing, and typography based on screen size. The HeroSection, for example, reduces font sizes and adjusts spacing on smaller screens.\n\n**Mobile Optimization**: Interactive elements have appropriate touch targets (minimum 44px), and navigation is simplified for mobile users.\n\n**Image Handling**: Background images and other media are optimized for different screen sizes with appropriate sizing and positioning.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Performance Optimization Tips\nTo ensure optimal performance when using these components, follow these best practices:\n\n**Component Composition**: Use the asChild prop when possible to avoid unnecessary wrapper divs and reduce DOM complexity.\n\n**Conditional Rendering**: Only render components when needed, especially heavy ones like Dialog or complex forms.\n\n**Event Handling**: The components properly clean up event listeners and intervals (like the CountdownTimer) to prevent memory leaks.\n\n**Image Optimization**: Use appropriately sized images and leverage browser caching. The application already uses optimized image formats (webp, png).\n\n**Code Splitting**: Consider lazy loading less frequently used components to reduce initial bundle size.\n\n**Avoid Unnecessary Re-renders**: The components use React.memo and proper dependency arrays in hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n\n## Common Implementation Issues\nWhen working with these components, developers may encounter the following common issues:\n\n**Language Context Missing**: Ensure that components using useLanguage are rendered within the LanguageProvider context. Otherwise, they will throw errors or display undefined text.\n\n**Form Validation Errors**: When using the Form components, ensure that react-hook-form is properly configured with a form context. Missing FormProvider will cause FormField components to fail.\n\n**Dialog Portal Issues**: The Dialog component uses a portal, which may cause z-index conflicts with other absolutely positioned elements. Adjust z-index values as needed.\n\n**Responsive Layout Breaks**: When customizing components, ensure that responsive classes are preserved to maintain mobile compatibility.\n\n**Theming Inconsistencies**: When overriding styles, use the cn utility function to properly merge classes and avoid conflicts with existing Tailwind classes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L130)\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-f7d4dfb2-f6d7-4977-b9be-6f6e04f6e3e2","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":26040,"completion_tokens":5575,"total_tokens":31615,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
