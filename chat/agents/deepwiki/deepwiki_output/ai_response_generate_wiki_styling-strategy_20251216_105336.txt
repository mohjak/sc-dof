Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the styling strategy focused on the Tailwind CSS implementation and design system. Explain how the tailwind.config.ts file extends the default theme with custom colors, fonts, and plugins like tailwindcss-animate. Describe the utility-first approach used throughout the components and how the cn() utility function from utils.ts enables conditional class composition. Detail the responsive design implementation using Tailwind's breakpoint system and how components adapt to mobile and desktop views. Include examples of complex styling patterns from the codebase, such as the floating language switcher's backdrop blur effect or the card component's shadow and border styling. Address common styling issues and provide optimization tips for reducing CSS bundle size.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nStyling Strategy\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers how the Tailwind configuration extends the default theme with custom colors, fonts, and animations, how the utility-first approach is applied across components, and how the cn() utility function enables safe conditional class composition. It also details responsive design using Tailwind’s breakpoint system, highlights complex styling patterns such as the floating language switcher’s backdrop blur effect and the card component’s shadow and border styling, and provides optimization tips for reducing CSS bundle size.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe styling pipeline is organized around a small set of foundational files:\n- Tailwind configuration defines theme extensions, plugins, and content scanning.\n- Global CSS establishes base styles, CSS variables, gradients, and reusable utilities.\n- PostCSS configuration integrates Tailwind and Autoprefixer.\n- The cn() utility merges Tailwind classes safely, while shadcn/ui primitives provide component-level variants.\n- Components apply utility-first styles and leverage responsive utilities and custom utilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  A[\"tailwind.config.ts\"] --\u003e B[\"Tailwind Engine\"]\n  B --\u003e C[\"Generated CSS Classes\"]\n  D[\"src/index.css\"] --\u003e B\n  E[\"postcss.config.js\"] --\u003e B\n  F[\"src/lib/utils.ts\"] --\u003e G[\"Components Using cn()\"]\n  H[\"src/components/ui/card.tsx\"] --\u003e G\n  I[\"src/components/ui/button.tsx\"] --\u003e G\n  J[\"src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"] --\u003e G\n  K[\"src/components/Navbar.tsx\"] --\u003e G\n  L[\"src/components/HeroSection.tsx\"] --\u003e G\n  M[\"src/components/AgendaSection.tsx\"] --\u003e G\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [src/components/ui/card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/components/Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [src/components/HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [src/components/AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n\n## Core Components\n- Tailwind configuration:\n  - Dark mode strategy uses a class-based approach.\n  - Content scanning targets pages, components, app, and src directories.\n  - Theme extension adds custom colors, typography families, border radius, and keyframe/animation definitions.\n  - Plugin integration includes tailwindcss-animate.\n- Global CSS:\n  - Defines CSS variables for color palettes and gradients.\n  - Establishes base layer styles and applies border defaults.\n  - Provides utility classes for gradients, glass effects, and glow shadows.\n  - Declares custom animations and staggered delays.\n- Utilities:\n  - cn() merges clsx and tailwind-merge to prevent class conflicts and deduplicate conflicting utilities.\n- UI primitives:\n  - Card and Button components demonstrate utility-first composition and variant systems.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [src/components/ui/card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe styling architecture follows a layered approach:\n- Variables and base styles live in global CSS.\n- Tailwind compiles utilities and animations from the configuration.\n- Components consume utilities and variants directly, enabling rapid iteration and consistency.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Theme Layer\"\n    Vars[\"CSS Variables\u003cbr/\u003eColors, Gradients, Shadows\"]\n    Fonts[\"Font Families\u003cbr/\u003eBahij Koufiya, Roboto\"]\n    Radius[\"Border Radius Values\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Tailwind Layer\"\n    Cfg[\"tailwind.config.ts\u003cbr/\u003eextend, plugins, content\"]\n    Anim[\"Keyframes \u0026 Animations\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Utilities Layer\"\n    Utils[\"cn() Merge Utility\"]\n    Primitives[\"UI Primitives\u003cbr/\u003eCard, Button Variants\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Components\"\n    Lang[\"LanguageSwitcher\"]\n    Nav[\"Navbar\"]\n    Hero[\"HeroSection\"]\n    Agenda[\"AgendaSection\"]\n  end\n\n  Vars --\u003e Cfg\n  Fonts --\u003e Cfg\n  Radius --\u003e Cfg\n  Cfg --\u003e Anim\n  Utils --\u003e Primitives\n  Primitives --\u003e Lang\n  Primitives --\u003e Nav\n  Primitives --\u003e Hero\n  Primitives --\u003e Agenda\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [src/components/ui/card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/components/Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [src/components/HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [src/components/AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Tailwind Configuration and Design Tokens\n- Theme extensions:\n  - Colors: semantic tokens mapped to CSS variables for light/dark modes, plus brand-specific tokens (Syrian red/green/black, gold, cream) and sidebar tokens.\n  - Typography: two font families configured for Arabic and multilingual contexts.\n  - Border radius: derived from a CSS variable for consistent rounding.\n  - Animations: accordion animations included via plugin.\n- Plugins:\n  - tailwindcss-animate is enabled for declarative motion utilities.\n- Content scanning:\n  - Ensures only used utilities are generated, keeping the bundle lean.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n### Global CSS and Base Styles\n- CSS variables define:\n  - Primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, and surface tokens for both light and dark themes.\n  - Brand tokens for Syrian identity and gold gradients.\n  - Shadow presets for consistent elevation.\n- Base layer:\n  - Applies border defaults globally and sets font family and anti-aliasing.\n- Utilities:\n  - Gradient helpers for hero, gold, and green.\n  - Text gradient utility.\n  - Glass effect utility using backdrop blur.\n  - Glow utilities for primary and gold.\n- Animations:\n  - Floating, pulsing glow, shimmer, fade-up, scaling, and confetti fall.\n  - Staggered delays for sequential animations.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n\n### Utility Composition with cn()\n- Purpose:\n  - Safely merge conditional classes while avoiding duplicates.\n- Implementation:\n  - Uses clsx for conditional class arrays and tailwind-merge for deduplication.\n- Usage patterns:\n  - UI primitives pass className props through cn().\n  - Components combine static and dynamic classes with confidence.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [src/components/ui/card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n### Responsive Design and Breakpoints\n- Breakpoint usage:\n  - md: used to hide/show mobile menus, adjust typography, and change layout grids.\n  - sm: used to show/hide labels and adjust sizes.\n- Hook-based detection:\n  - useIsMobile determines mobile state using a media query listener against a fixed breakpoint.\n- Component examples:\n  - Navbar toggles mobile menu visibility and adjusts backdrop blur and shadow on scroll.\n  - HeroSection adapts typography and spacing across breakpoints.\n  - AgendaSection stacks and tiles cards responsively.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n- [src/components/Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [src/components/HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [src/components/AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n\n### Floating Language Switcher: Backdrop Blur Effect\n- Pattern:\n  - Fixed positioning with z-index and rounded container.\n  - Background uses card/90 with backdrop blur for frosted glass effect.\n  - Shadow and border provide depth and contrast against backgrounds.\n  - Conditional classes switch between floating and navbar variants.\n- Animation and typography:\n  - Uses Roboto for non-Arabic labels and hides labels on small screens.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Render LanguageSwitcher\"]) --\u003e CheckVariant{\"Variant == 'floating'?\"}\n  CheckVariant --\u003e|Yes| ApplyFloating[\"Apply fixed position\u003cbr/\u003ebg-card/90 + backdrop-blur-sm\u003cbr/\u003eshadow-lg + border border-border\u003cbr/\u003erounded-full + p-1\"]\n  CheckVariant --\u003e|No| ApplyNavbar[\"Apply bg-transparent\u003cbr/\u003erounded-full + p-1\"]\n  ApplyFloating --\u003e LoopLangs[\"Map languages\"]\n  ApplyNavbar --\u003e LoopLangs\n  LoopLangs --\u003e Active{\"language == lang.code?\"}\n  Active --\u003e|Yes| Selected[\"bg-syrian-green + text-primary-foreground\"]\n  Active --\u003e|No| Hover[\"hover:bg-syrian-green/20 + text-foreground\"]\n  Selected --\u003e Labels[\"Show labels conditionally by screen size\"]\n  Hover --\u003e Labels\n  Labels --\u003e End([\"Done\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L172)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L172)\n\n### Card Component: Shadow and Border Styling\n- Pattern:\n  - Rounded corners, border, and subtle shadow for depth.\n  - Uses card and card-foreground tokens for consistent theming.\n  - Header, Title, Description, Content, and Footer segments compose with shared spacing and typography.\n- Variants:\n  -

CSS variables for color tokens.\n  - Global utilities for gradients and effects.\n- Components depend on:\n  - Tailwind utilities for layout and typography.\n  - cn() for safe class merging.\n  - UI primitives for consistent variants.\n- Build pipeline:\n  - PostCSS runs Tailwind and Autoprefixer.\n  - Dependencies include Tailwind, tailwind-merge, and tailwindcss-animate.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Pkg[\"package.json\u003cbr/\u003edependencies/plugins\"] --\u003e Post[\"postcss.config.js\"]\n  Post --\u003e TW[\"tailwindcss\"]\n  TW --\u003e Cfg[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  Cfg --\u003e CSS[\"src/index.css\"]\n  CSS --\u003e Comps[\"Components\"]\n  Utils[\"src/lib/utils.ts\"] --\u003e Comps\n  Prims[\"ui primitives\"] --\u003e Comps\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [src/components/ui/card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [src/components/ui/card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Keep content scanning scoped:\n  - The configuration scans pages, components, app, and src directories. Ensure only relevant paths are included to minimize generated utilities.\n- Prefer CSS variables for theme tokens:\n  - Using HSL variables ensures consistent theming across light/dark modes without duplicating utilities.\n- Use utility-first composition:\n  - Combine small, composable utilities rather than writing bespoke CSS to reduce duplication.\n- Limit animation-heavy elements:\n  - Animations like confetti and shimmer are visually appealing but can increase DOM complexity. Use sparingly and consider disabling on constrained devices.\n- Optimize font loading:\n  - The project loads custom fonts via @font-face. Ensure fonts are preloaded or cached appropriately to avoid layout shifts.\n- Bundle size tips:\n  - Remove unused utilities by scoping content globs tightly.\n  - Avoid excessive nesting in custom utilities; prefer flat, composable utilities.\n  - Consolidate repeated gradients and shadows into utility classes to reduce duplication.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Dark mode not applying:\n  - Verify the darkMode strategy is set to class and that the class is toggled on the root element.\n- Unexpected class collisions:\n  - Ensure cn() is used to merge classes so tailwind-merge deduplicates conflicting utilities.\n- Responsive breakpoints not triggering:\n  - Confirm md/sm prefixes are used correctly and that useIsMobile hook aligns with Tailwind’s breakpoints.\n- Backdrop blur not visible:\n  - Ensure the browser supports backdrop-filter and that the element has sufficient background contrast or transparency.\n- Animations not playing:\n  - Check that animation utilities are defined and that the elements are not hidden or clipped by overflow.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n- [src/index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L172)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe project’s styling strategy centers on a robust Tailwind configuration, a comprehensive set of CSS variables and utilities, and a utility-first component architecture. The cn() utility ensures predictable class composition, while responsive utilities and a dedicated mobile hook enable seamless adaptation across devices. Complex patterns like the floating language switcher’s glass effect and the hero section’s layered animations showcase the power of combining Tailwind utilities with custom CSS. Following the optimization tips and troubleshooting guidance will help maintain a fast, consistent, and scalable design system.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-16c16414-9f03-432c-9515-04c947228ba4","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":27375,"completion_tokens":4612,"total_tokens":31987,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
