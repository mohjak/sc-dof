Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate detailed documentation for the Button UI component.

Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

User Workflow Mapping\\nCommon user scenarios:\\n1. User visits site → Language selection → Views event information in selected language\\n2. User navigates through event sections using navbar or scrolling\\n3. User views event details (date, time, location) and clicks to view on map\\n4. User explores agenda, speakers, and organizers\\n5. User registers for event through registration section\\n6. User switches languages at any point to view content in preferred language\\n\\nKey entry points:\\n- Main page (Index) as primary entry point\\n- Direct links to specific sections (agenda, speakers, etc.)\\n- Language switcher for immediate language selection\\n\\n13.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\\n3. Do not use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\\n\\u003c/tool_calling\\u003e\\n\\nYour goal is to construct a project-specific documentation framework derived from comprehensive analysis of the codebase, README, and supporting materials. The structure should serve as the foundation for a documentation website, catering to both beginners and experienced developers/users.\\n\\nImplementation steps:\\n1. Structure Development:\\n   Build a multi-level documentation hierarchy that reflects the project's component organization\\n2. Requirement Compliance:\\n   Make sure that structural alignment with all listed documentation requirements below\\n3. Output Generation:\\n   Format final results in the required JSON format\\n\\nHere are the requirements for the documentation structure generation:\\n1. Should only include sections that correspond to actual codebase components, services, and implemented features in the project.\\n2. Structure organization should follow project's logical flow and maintain architectural layering.\\n3. Terminology must match project's codebase vocabulary and use consistent naming conventions.\\n4. Include All API documentation to cover all public interfaces and include endpoint specifications.\\n5. In the content, learning progression should start with basic concepts, then progress to advanced topics.\\n6. Balance high-level overviews with detailed reference documentation.\\n7. Include sections for getting Started guide, installation instructions and basic usage examples.\\n8. Provide dedicated sections for each feature, sub-feature, database schema, API and service.\\n9. Content coverage must include all complete features and sub-feature sets.\\n10. Advanced content such as troubleshooting guides and expert-level usage should be included in appropriate place.\\n11. Address configuration, customization, and extension points.\\n12. Reference material should be in logical organization, easy-access patterns.\\n13. For each section, identify and include the most relevant source files from the project as dependent_file entries.\\n14. If the project is very simple, the document structure should be as simple as possible.\\n15. If no valid files exist (e.g., all are images, binary files, etc.), you should not generate any documents.\\n16. The current codebase has 90 valid files, if the number of valid files is less than 50, the document structure can only have one level, and only a brief introduction to the files is provided\\n17. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\\n\\nOutput Format:\\nThe final output should be a JSON structure representing the documentation hierarchy. Use the following format:\\n\\n**CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**\\n1. You MUST start your response with \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e (opening tag)\\n2. You MUST end your response with \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e (closing tag)\\n3. Do NOT use any other format or tags\\n4. The complete analysis should be wrapped between \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e and \\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e tags\\n5. The prompt MUST be as detailed as possible, specifying what content needs to be included and detailed guidance on the structure of the content\\n\\n**JSON Structure Fields:**\\n- title: **Required** section-identifier\\n- name: **Required** Section name\\n- dependent_file: **Required** List of dependent files for chapter information, It is a relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\\n- prompt: **Required**\\n    - For the summary section or root layer: Create comprehensive content for this section focused on [SPECIFIC PROJECT COMPONENT/FEATURE].

Include style customization options and theming support. Address cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization. Document component composition patterns and integration with other UI elements.\\n- children_plan: **Required** Think about how to subdivide the next-level document structure to children or no further splitting is needed. Only split into sub-sections when the content is complex; if the content is very simple, avoid excessive splitting.\\n    - **Example:**\\n        - The features/modules are too complex for one document to cover all the knowledge, and need to be split section1, section2 into the children section\\n        - The module contains multiple features such as feature1, feature2, etc., and needs to be described in detail in the subsections.\\n        - The feature is too simple. The current document is sufficient to cover the introduction, no need to split.\\n        - The document is an overview type and should be concise, no further splitting is needed.\\n        - The parent document is not a non-essential type such as an overview or test, and contains multiple complex sub-functions; the current document only provides a general overview of these sub-functions and requires further subdivision and detailed explanation.\\n        - Hierarchy is too deep to be further subdivided.\\n        - No further splitting is needed.\\n        - Related documents and their sub-documents, such as overview, testing, deployment, appendix, and core concepts, should be described within 1 to 2 levels, without excessive splitting.\\n        - Getting started, technology stack, contributing needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n- has_children: **Required** After children plan, you MUST follow the children plan requirements to split the document substructure into children.\\n\\n**JSON Structure Requirements:**\\n- **Hierarchical Organization**: Use nested children for logical groupings\\n- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include every significant aspect without omission\\n- **File Mapping**: Link each section to relevant source files for accuracy\\n- **Enhanced Prompts**: Each prompt must be detailed, action-oriented, and technically specific\\n- **Balanced Structure**: Maintain 1-4 levels of depth maximum for most documentation\\n\\n**Section Prompt Enhancement:**\\nEach section prompt must include:\\n- **Specific Component Focus**: Clear identification of what aspect is being documented\\n- **Implementation Details**: Technical depth appropriate for the component complexity\\n- **Practical Examples**: Concrete code examples and usage patterns from the actual codebase\\n- **Integration Context**: How this component relates to others in the system\\n- **Troubleshooting Guidance**: Common issues and their solutions\\n- **Performance Considerations**: Optimization tips and best practices where relevant\\n\\n**Section Children Plan Enhancement:**\\n- Consider whether and how to split the next level of section\\n- If the current section contains multiple sub-functional features, the next level section should be split up\\n- if it is already the smallest component or feature, don't split it.\\n- Aim for a balance between document depth and maintainability\\n- Avoid excessive nesting that makes navigation difficult\\n- Project overview, introduction, technology stack, getting started, testing, deployment, contributing and their sub-sections should not require children sections as much as possible\\n- Getting started, technology stack needs to be as simple as possible, introduced in a single document, without splitting into subsections\\n\\n**Section Children Instructions:**\\n- According to the children plan content, if there is no need to tear down the molecular level, set has_children to 'YES'; otherwise, set has_children to 'NO'\\n\\nGenerate your response using this exact JSON structure, with no additional text before or after:\\n\\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e\\n{\\n  \\\"items\\\": [\\n    {\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"section-identifier\\\",\\n      \\\"name\\\": \\\"Section Name\\\",\\n      \\\"dependent_file\\\": [\\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file1.ext\\\", \\\"relativepath/to/relevant/file2.ext\\\"],\\n      \\\"prompt\\\": \\\"Create comprehensive content ... or Develop detailed content for ...\\\",\\n      \\\"children_plan\\\": \\\"...\\\"\\n      \\\"has_children\\\": \\\"YES or NO\\\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n\\u003c/documentation_structure\\u003e\\n\\nProvide your final repository structure content within \\u003cdocumentation_structure\\u003e tags.

It explains the implementation built on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, details all props and variants, and demonstrates usage patterns from the codebase. It also covers accessibility features, integration with the global theme and RTL layout, common styling issues, and performance best practices.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe Button component is part of the ShadCN UI library and is located under the ui directory. It integrates with utility functions for class composition and the Tailwind theme for consistent styling. Usage examples appear in RegistrationSection and Navbar.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"UI Library\"\n    B[\"Button\u003cbr/\u003esrc/components/ui/button.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Utilities\"\n    U[\"cn()\u003cbr/\u003esrc/lib/utils.ts\"]\n    TW[\"Tailwind Theme\u003cbr/\u003etailwind.config.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Sections\"\n    RS[\"RegistrationSection\u003cbr/\u003esrc/components/RegistrationSection.tsx\"]\n    NB[\"Navbar\u003cbr/\u003esrc/components/Navbar.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Global Providers\"\n    APP[\"App\u003cbr/\u003esrc/App.tsx\"]\n    LC[\"LanguageContext\u003cbr/\u003esrc/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  RS --\u003e B\n  NB --\u003e B\n  B --\u003e U\n  U --\u003e TW\n  APP --\u003e LC\n  LC --\u003e APP\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L47)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L99)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L11-L30)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L47)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L99)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L11-L30)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n\n## Core Components\n- Button component: A flexible, accessible button built on Radix Slot and styled with Tailwind CSS. It supports variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link), sizes (default, sm, lg, icon), and an asChild option for composition.\n- Utility function cn: Merges and deduplicates Tailwind classes using clsx and tailwind-merge.\n- Tailwind theme: Provides color tokens and spacing scales consumed by Button variants and sizes.\n- Global providers: App wraps the app with providers that enable RTL layout and language-aware typography.\n\nKey implementation highlights:\n- Variants and sizes are defined via class-variance-authority and applied through a variant function.\n- Focus-visible ring styles are included for keyboard accessibility.\n- Disabled state and pointer-events are handled consistently.\n- asChild prop allows rendering a different element (e.g., anchor) while preserving Button styles.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L7-L31)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L33-L47)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L20-L74)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe Button component participates in a layered architecture:\n- Component layer: Button defines variants, sizes, and composition via asChild.\n- Styling layer: Tailwind theme and cn utility compose final class strings.\n- Integration layer: Sections like RegistrationSection and Navbar pass props and wrap Button around anchors or other elements.\n- Global layer: App and LanguageContext manage RTL direction and language-dependent fonts.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant RS as \"RegistrationSection\"\n  participant BTN as \"Button\"\n  participant CN as \"cn()\"\n  participant TW as \"Tailwind Theme\"\n  participant NB as \"Navbar\"\n  participant LC as \"LanguageContext\"\n  participant APP as \"App\"\n\n  RS-\u003e\u003eBTN: Render with size=\"lg\", className overrides\n  BTN-\u003e\u003eCN: Compose variant + size + className\n  CN-\u003e\u003eTW: Resolve color tokens and spacing\n  TW--\u003e\u003eCN: Resolved classes\n  CN--\u003e\u003eBTN: Final class string\n  BTN--\u003e\u003eRS: Rendered anchor with Button styles\n\n  NB-\u003e\u003eBTN: Render with variant/size as needed\n  LC--\u003e\u003eAPP: Provide isRTL and language\n  APP--\u003e\u003eNB: Apply dir={isRTL ?

Supported values: default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link.\n  - size: Controls height, padding, and border radius. Supported values: default, sm, lg, icon.\n  - asChild: When true, renders the child element passed via slot composition (e.g., wrapping an anchor).\n  - Inherits standard button attributes (e.g., disabled, type).\n- Behavior:\n  - Focus-visible ring and offset are included for keyboard accessibility.\n  - Disabled state applies pointer-events-none and reduced opacity.\n  - SVG inside Button receives pointer-events-none and constrained sizing.\n\nUsage examples from the codebase:\n- RegistrationSection uses Button with asChild to render an anchor link with large size and custom background classes.\n- Navbar uses native buttons for mobile menu toggling and anchor links for desktop navigation.\n\nAccessibility features:\n- Focus-visible ring ensures keyboard users can perceive focus.\n- Disabled state prevents interactive behavior and communicates state to assistive technologies.\n- asChild preserves semantics when wrapping interactive elements.\n\nIntegration with theme and RTL:\n- Tailwind theme defines color tokens (primary, secondary, destructive, accent, etc.) consumed by Button variants.\n- App applies dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'} based on language context, enabling RTL layout for the entire app.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L7-L31)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L33-L47)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L99)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L20-L74)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L11-L30)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n\n### Class Composition and Styling\n- cn utility merges multiple class inputs and resolves conflicts using tailwind-merge.\n- Button variants and sizes are defined centrally and composed into a single class string.\n- Custom className passed to Button augments the base variant/size classes.\n\nCommon styling pitfalls and solutions:\n- Conflicting Tailwind classes: Use cn to merge classes safely; avoid overriding variant classes directly.\n- Inline styles causing re-renders: Prefer passing className via props instead of creating new objects on each render.\n- Browser inconsistencies: Ensure Tailwind JIT compiles all variants; verify theme tokens are defined.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L7-L31)\n\n### Usage Patterns in the Codebase\n- RegistrationSection:\n  - Uses Button with asChild to wrap an anchor element.\n  - Applies size=\"lg\" and additional custom classes for visual prominence.\n  - Demonstrates composition of Button with an external icon and link target.\n- Navbar:\n  - Uses native buttons for interactive elements (mobile menu toggle).\n  - Uses anchor links for navigation with hover and focus states managed by Button’s base styles.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant RS as \"RegistrationSection\"\n  participant BTN as \"Button\"\n  participant ANCHOR as \"Anchor\"\n  participant CN as \"cn()\"\n  participant TW as \"Tailwind Theme\"\n\n  RS-\u003e\u003eBTN: asChild=true, size=\"lg\", className=\"...\"\n  BTN-\u003e\u003eANCHOR: Render anchor with Button classes\n  BTN-\u003e\u003eCN: Compose variant + size + className\n  CN-\u003e\u003eTW: Resolve tokens\n  TW--\u003e\u003eCN: Classes\n  CN--\u003e\u003eBTN: Final class string\n  BTN--\u003e\u003eANCHOR: Rendered with styles\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L99)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L33-L47)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L20-L74)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L80-L99)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n\n### Accessibility and Keyboard Handling\n- Focus management:\n  - Focus-visible ring ensures keyboard navigation is clearly indicated.\n  - Disabled state prevents focus and interaction.\n- Semantic composition:\n  - asChild preserves semantics when wrapping interactive elements (e.g., anchors).\n- ARIA considerations:\n  - Provide aria-labels for icon-only buttons.\n  - Ensure sufficient color contrast for all variants against backgrounds.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L7-L31)\n\n### Integration with Global Theme and RTL\n- Tailwind theme:\n  - Color tokens (primary, secondary, destructive, accent) are defined and consumed by Button variants.\n  - Spacing and radius scales are standardized for consistent sizing across sizes.\n- RTL layout:\n  - App applies dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'} based on language context.\n  - LanguageContext determines isRTL and language, enabling layout and font adjustments.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L20-L74)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L11-L30)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nThe Button component depends on:\n- Radix Slot for composition (asChild).\n- class-variance-authority for variant and size definitions.\n- cn utility for safe class merging.\n- Tailwind theme for color tokens and spacing.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  BTN[\"Button\u003cbr/\u003ebutton.tsx\"] --\u003e RADIX[\"Radix Slot\"]\n  BTN --\u003e CVA[\"class-variance-authority\"]\n  BTN --\u003e CN[\"cn()\u003cbr/\u003eutils.ts\"]\n  CN --\u003e TW[\"Tailwind Theme\u003cbr/\u003etailwind.config.ts\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L47)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L47)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Avoid inline onClick handlers:\n  - Passing a new function on each render causes unnecessary re-renders. Define handlers outside the render path or memoize them.\n- Minimize className churn:\n  - Prefer static className strings or memoized values to avoid recalculating class lists.\n- Use variants and sizes judiciously:\n  - Excessive custom className overrides can bloat the final class string; keep overrides minimal.\n- Bundle size:\n  - The Button component is small and tree-shaken via the UI library; avoid importing unused variants.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Button not responding to keyboard focus:\n  - Ensure focus-visible ring is not overridden by custom styles.\n  - Verify disabled state is not unintentionally applied.\n- Incorrect RTL behavior:\n  - Confirm App applies dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'} and that language context is initialized.\n- Conflicting styles:\n  - Use cn to merge classes; avoid duplicating variant classes.\n- Hover/focus states not visible:\n  - Check that hover variants are defined in the theme and that focus-visible ring is present.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L7-L31)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L11-L30)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Button component provides a robust, accessible foundation for interactive elements across the application. Its integration with Radix Slot, class-variance-authority, and Tailwind CSS enables consistent styling and behavior. By following the usage patterns demonstrated in RegistrationSection and Navbar, and adhering to the accessibility and performance recommendations, developers can reliably extend and customize Button for diverse UI needs.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-aca1c18c-9cc6-4d54-bfbb-b77237227884","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":57237,"completion_tokens":3407,"total_tokens":60644,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
