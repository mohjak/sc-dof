Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the component architecture section, focusing on the hierarchical structure and composition patterns used throughout the application. Explain how the App component serves as the root container with providers for QueryClient, LanguageProvider, and TooltipProvider. Describe how the Index page composes high-level section components like HeroSection, AgendaSection, and SpeakersSection. Detail the relationship between custom components and the ShadCN UI library components they consume. Illustrate component composition patterns with examples from the codebase, such as how Navbar uses Button and DropdownMenu components. Address common issues in component communication and state propagation, and provide best practices for component organization and reusability.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nComponent Architecture\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It describes how the App component acts as the root container with providers for QueryClient, LanguageProvider, and TooltipProvider. It details how the Index page composes high-level sections such as HeroSection, AgendaSection, and SpeakersSection. It also clarifies how custom components integrate with ShadCN UI primitives and components, and illustrates composition patterns with examples like Navbar’s use of Button and DropdownMenu components. Finally, it addresses common issues in component communication and state propagation and provides best practices for organization and reusability.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe application follows a clear feature-based and layer-based organization:\n- Root entry point initializes the React app and mounts the App component.\n- App wraps the application with provider layers for internationalization, tooltips, and data fetching.\n- The Index page composes multiple section components to build the main landing page.\n- Custom components are grouped under src/components, while ShadCN UI primitives live under src/components/ui.\n- Utility functions centralize Tailwind class merging.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  main_tsx[\"src/main.tsx\"] --\u003e app_tsx[\"src/App.tsx\"]\n  app_tsx --\u003e index_tsx[\"src/pages/Index.tsx\"]\n  index_tsx --\u003e navbar[\"src/components/Navbar.tsx\"]\n  index_tsx --\u003e hero[\"src/components/HeroSection.tsx\"]\n  index_tsx --\u003e agenda[\"src/components/AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n  index_tsx --\u003e speakers[\"src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx\"]\n  index_tsx --\u003e footer[\"src/components/Footer.tsx\"]\n  navbar --\u003e lang_switcher[\"src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  hero --\u003e countdown[\"src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx\"]\n  lang_switcher --\u003e lang_ctx[\"src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  app_tsx --\u003e lang_ctx\n  app_txs --\u003e tooltip_ui[\"src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx\"]\n  app_txs --\u003e button_ui[\"src/components/ui/button.tsx\"]\n  app_txs --\u003e dropdown_ui[\"src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx\"]\n  utils[\"src/lib/utils.ts\"] --\u003e button_ui\n  utils --\u003e tooltip_ui\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [dropdown-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx#L1-L180)\n- [tooltip.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx#L1-L29)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Core Components\n- App component: The root container that wires providers for QueryClient, TooltipProvider, and LanguageProvider around the application content. It also renders routing and toasts.\n- Index page: The main page that composes all major sections and the Navbar/Footer.\n- LanguageContext: Provides language state, translation function, and RTL direction to the app.\n- ShadCN UI primitives: Reusable base components (Button, DropdownMenu, Tooltip) used by custom components.\n\nKey provider stack and routing:\n- Providers wrap the application in this order: QueryClientProvider -\u003e TooltipProvider -\u003e LanguageProvider -\u003e AppContent -\u003e Router -\u003e Routes.\n- The Index page composes sections in a logical flow from top to bottom.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe architecture is layered:\n- Presentation layer: Pages and components (e.g., Index, Navbar, HeroSection).\n- Composition layer: Sections composed by the Index page.\n- Provider layer: Language, UI, and data providers.\n- UI foundation: ShadCN primitives consumed by custom components.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Presentation Layer\"\n    index_page[\"Index Page\"]\n    sections[\"Sections\u003cbr/\u003eHeroSection, AgendaSection, SpeakersSection, Footer\"]\n    navbar[\"Navbar\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Composition Layer\"\n    index_page --\u003e sections\n    index_page --\u003e navbar\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Provider Layer\"\n    lang_provider[\"LanguageProvider\"]\n    tooltip_provider[\"TooltipProvider\"]\n    query_client[\"QueryClientProvider\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"UI Foundation\"\n    shad_button[\"ShadCN Button\"]\n    shad_dropdown[\"ShadCN DropdownMenu\"]\n    shad_tooltip[\"ShadCN Tooltip\"]\n    utils_cn[\"utils.cn()\"]\n  end\n\n  app_root[\"App Root\"] --\u003e lang_provider --\u003e tooltip_provider --\u003e query_client\n  index_page --\u003e sections\n  navbar --\u003e lang_provider\n  hero_section[\"HeroSection\"] --\u003e countdown_timer[\"CountdownTimer\"]\n  hero_section --\u003e utils_cn\n  agenda_section[\"AgendaSection\"] --\u003e utils_cn\n  speakers_section[\"SpeakersSection\"] --\u003e utils_cn\n  footer_component[\"Footer\"] --\u003e utils_cn\n  navbar --\u003e shad_button\n  navbar --\u003e shad_dropdown\n  tooltip_provider --\u003e shad_tooltip\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [dropdown-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx#L1-L180)\n- [tooltip.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx#L1-L29)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### App Root Container and Providers\n- The App component sets up the provider stack and routes:\n  - QueryClientProvider wraps the entire app for data fetching.\n  - TooltipProvider enables global tooltip behavior.\n  - LanguageProvider supplies language state and translation to all components.\n  - Router and Routes define the Index page as the root route and a catch-all for 404.\n- AppContent applies directional layout and font classes based on language and renders toasts.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Root as \"main.tsx\"\n  participant App as \"App.tsx\"\n  participant Providers as \"Providers Stack\"\n  participant Router as \"React Router\"\n  participant Index as \"Index.tsx\"\n\n  Root-\u003e\u003eApp: render \u003cApp/\u003e\n  App-\u003e\u003eProviders: wrap with QueryClientProvider, TooltipProvider, LanguageProvider\n  Providers-\u003e\u003eRouter: render \u003cBrowserRouter\u003e\n  Router-\u003e\u003eIndex: render \u003cRoute path=\"/\" element={\u003cIndex/\u003e}/\u003e\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n\n### Index Page Composition\n- The Index page composes the full-page layout by importing and rendering:\n  - Navbar, HeroSection, WhySection, GoalsSection, DetailsSection, AgendaSection, SpeakersSection, OrganizersSection, RegistrationSection, Footer, and ScrollToTop.\n- This establishes a clear, top-to-bottom composition pattern for the landing page.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Index.tsx\"]) --\u003e RenderNavbar[\"Render Navbar\"]\n  RenderNavbar --\u003e RenderHero[\"Render HeroSection\"]\n  RenderHero --\u003e RenderWhy[\"Render WhySection\"]\n  RenderWhy --\u003e RenderGoals[\"Render GoalsSection\"]\n  RenderGoals --\u003e RenderDetails[\"Render DetailsSection\"]\n  RenderDetails --\u003e RenderAgenda[\"Render AgendaSection\"]\n  RenderAgenda --\u003e RenderSpeakers[\"Render SpeakersSection\"]\n  RenderSpeakers --\u003e RenderOrganizers[\"Render OrganizersSection\"]\n  RenderOrganizers --\u003e RenderRegistration[\"Render RegistrationSection\"]\n  RenderRegistration --\u003e RenderFooter[\"Render Footer\"]\n  RenderFooter --\u003e RenderScrollToTop[\"Render ScrollToTop\"]\n  RenderScrollToTop --\u003e End([\"Done\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n### Navbar Composition and ShadCN Integration\n- Navbar integrates:\n  - LanguageSwitcher for language selection.\n  - Scroll behavior to navigate to sections.\n  - Responsive mobile menu toggle.\n- Navbar consumes:\n  - Button and DropdownMenu primitives indirectly via LanguageSwitcher and internal UI patterns.\n  - TooltipProvider for tooltip support.\n  - LanguageContext for translations and RTL direction.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Navbar as \"Navbar.tsx\"\n  participant LangCtx as \"LanguageContext\"\n  participant LangSwitcher as \"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"\n  participant UI as \"ShadCN UI\"\n\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eLangCtx: useLanguage()\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eNavbar: compute nav links and scroll handlers\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eLangSwitcher: render LanguageSwitcher variant=\"navbar\"\n  LangSwitcher-\u003e\u003eLangCtx: useLanguage()\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eUI: uses Button/DropdownMenu patterns internally\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [dropdown-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx#L1-L180)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### HeroSection Composition and Subcomponents\n- HeroSection composes:\n  - Decorative assets and animations.\n  - CountdownTimer for dynamic countdown display.\n  - LanguageContext for localized text.\n- It demonstrates composition by importing and rendering CountdownTimer as part of the hero content.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"] --\u003e Assets[\"Background + Emblems\"]\n  Hero --\u003e LocalizedText[\"Localized Titles/Subtitles\"]\n  Hero --\u003e Countdown[\"CountdownTimer.tsx\"]\n  Hero --\u003e Utils[\"utils.cn()\"]\n  Countdown --\u003e LangCtx[\"LanguageContext\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n\n### AgendaSection Composition Pattern\n- AgendaSection builds a responsive grid of agenda items.\n- It uses LanguageContext for localized titles and descriptions and applies Tailwind classes via utils.cn().\n- The component demonstrates a clean separation between data (agenda items) and presentation.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Agenda[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"] --\u003e Data[\"Agenda Items Array\"]\n  Agenda --\u003e Grid[\"Responsive Grid Layout\"]\n  Agenda --\u003e Localized[\"Localized Text via LanguageContext\"]\n  Agenda --\u003e Utils[\"utils.cn()\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n\n### SpeakersSection Composition and Internationalization\n- SpeakersSection defines a typed speaker list and renders a responsive grid.\n- It uses LanguageContext to select localized names and roles based on current language.\n- It demonstrates robust internationalization and fallbacks for missing images.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Speakers[\"SpeakersSection.tsx\"] --\u003e Data[\"Speaker List\"]\n  Speakers --\u003e Localize[\"Select Name/Role by Language\"]\n  Speakers --\u003e Grid[\"Responsive Grid\"]\n  Speakers --\u003e Utils[\"utils.cn()\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n\n### Footer Composition and Social Links\n- Footer renders branding, social links, and localized text.\n- It uses LanguageContext for dynamic subtitles and labels and Tailwind utilities via utils.cn().\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Footer[\"Footer.tsx\"] --\u003e Branding[\"Branding Images\"]\n  Footer --\u003e Social[\"Social Links\"]\n  Footer --\u003e Localized[\"Localized Text\"]\n  Footer --\u003e Utils[\"utils.cn()\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n\n### Relationship Between Custom Components and ShadCN UI\n- Custom components consume ShadCN primitives through:\n  - Direct usage of Button and DropdownMenu patterns in Navbar and LanguageSwitcher.\n  - TooltipProvider enabling global tooltip behavior across the app.\n  - Utilities like utils.cn() for composing Tailwind classes consistently.\n- This pattern ensures consistent styling and behavior while keeping custom components focused on domain logic.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class App {\n    +providers(QueryClient, Tooltip, Language)\n    +router(Routes)\n  }\n  class Navbar {\n    +uses LanguageContext\n    +uses Button/DropdownMenu patterns\n  }\n  class LanguageSwitcher {\n    +uses LanguageContext\n  }\n  class LanguageContext {\n    +language\n    +setLanguage()\n    +t()\n    +isRTL\n  }\n  class Button\n  class DropdownMenu\n  class TooltipProvider\n  class utils_cn\n\n  App --\u003e LanguageContext : \"provides\"\n  App --\u003e TooltipProvider : \"wraps\"\n  App --\u003e Navbar : \"renders\"\n  Navbar --\u003e LanguageSwitcher : \"renders\"\n  Navbar --\u003e Button : \"uses patterns\"\n  Navbar --\u003e DropdownMenu : \"uses patterns\"\n  LanguageSwitcher --\u003e LanguageContext : \"consumes\"\n  utils_cn \u003c..

The current stack is appropriate for this app’s scope.\n- Rendering cost:\n  - Sections are static aside from CountdownTimer; consider memoizing heavy computations if added later.\n- Event listeners:\n  - Navbar scroll listener is attached and cleaned up; ensure cleanup in all components that attach window events.\n- Tailwind class merging:\n  - utils.cn() reduces class conflicts and improves runtime performance by merging classes efficiently.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and best practices:\n- LanguageContext not wrapped:\n  - Ensure LanguageProvider is present in the tree. Components using useLanguage must be descendants of the provider.\n  - Symptom: errors when calling useLanguage outside provider.\n- Tooltip not appearing:\n  - Ensure TooltipProvider is rendered at the root level.\n- Navbar scroll not working:\n  - Verify anchor IDs match section IDs and that smooth scrolling is supported by the browser.\n- CountdownTimer not updating:\n  - Confirm interval is cleared on unmount and that the event date is correct.\n- Class conflicts:\n  - Use utils.cn() to merge Tailwind classes and avoid duplication.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe component architecture cleanly separates concerns across provider, composition, and UI layers. The App component serves as a robust root container with essential providers, while the Index page composes high-level sections that encapsulate domain logic. Custom components integrate ShadCN UI primitives thoughtfully, leveraging LanguageContext for internationalization and utils.cn() for consistent styling. Following the outlined composition patterns and best practices will help maintain scalability, readability, and reliability as the application evolves.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-39a76194-eb1e-49b3-be91-c2153f5a668f","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":34027,"completion_tokens":5565,"total_tokens":39592,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
