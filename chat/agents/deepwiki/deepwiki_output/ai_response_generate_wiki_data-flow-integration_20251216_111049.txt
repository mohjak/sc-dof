Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate architectural documentation for the data flow between eventData.ts and LanguageContext.tsx and their integration into UI components. Describe how static event data and dynamic translation data are combined to render multilingual content. Illustrate the data pathway from source files to components like HeroSection (using eventData.title and t('hero.title')), AgendaSection (mapping agenda items with translated labels), and SpeakersSection (potential future integration). Explain the role of React's rendering lifecycle in updating content when language changes. Include diagrams showing component hierarchy and data dependencies. Address challenges such as data consistency, handling asynchronous updates if data moves to external APIs, and optimizing re-renders when switching languages.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nData Flow and Integration\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It traces the data pathway from the static event data source to UI components such as HeroSection, AgendaSection, and SpeakersSection, and describes how React’s rendering lifecycle responds to language changes. It also covers component hierarchy, data dependencies, and strategies for maintaining data consistency, handling asynchronous updates, and optimizing re-renders during language switches.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe application follows a layered structure:\n- Data layer: Static event data is centralized in a single module.\n- Internationalization layer: A React context manages language state and provides translation keys mapped to localized strings.\n- UI layer: Page and component modules consume translation keys and static event data to render content.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph

a single module exporting structured event metadata (title, date, venue, agenda, organizers, highlights).\n- Translation provider: A React context that holds the current language, exposes a translation function, and computes directionality.\n- UI components: Each component consumes translation keys via the hook and renders content accordingly.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n- eventData.ts: Provides static, immutable event data consumed by multiple UI sections.\n- LanguageContext.tsx: Provides language state, translation function, and RTL detection; wraps the app.\n- UI components: Render content using translation keys and static event data.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe data flow integrates static event data and dynamic translation keys into UI components through a predictable pipeline:\n- App initialization sets up the translation provider and routes.\n- Components request translations via the hook and render localized strings.\n- Static event data is accessed directly by components that need structured content (e.g., agenda, organizers).\n- Language changes propagate through the provider, causing components to re-render with updated content.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Root as \"main.tsx\"\n  participant App as \"App.tsx\"\n  participant Provider as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant Page as \"Index.tsx\"\n

event data (if needed)\n  Comp--\u003e\u003eComp: Render localized content\n  Note over Provider,Comp: When language changes, Provider updates state and triggers re-render\n```\n\n**Diagram

translated labels\nAgendaSection builds a list of agenda items by combining:\n- Static agenda data from the event data module.\n- Translation keys for each agenda segment’s time, title, and description.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"AgendaSection render\"]) --\u003e GetLang[\"Call useLanguage()\"]\n  GetLang --\u003e LoadStatic[\"Load static agenda items from eventData\"]\n

and roles\nSpeakersSection demonstrates a hybrid approach:\n- Uses translation keys for section titles and subtitles.\n- Uses language-aware selection for speaker names and roles (Arabic, English, Turkish) directly from the static data.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"SpeakersSection render\"]) --\u003e GetLang[\"Call useLanguage()\"]\n  GetLang --\u003e ChooseLang[\"Select language-aware name/role\"]\n  ChooseLang --\u003e RenderCards[\"Render speaker cards with localized text\"]\n  RenderCards --\u003e End([\"DOM updated\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n-

[WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Provider dependency: All components depend on the LanguageContext provider for translations and directionality.\n- Static data dependency: Several components depend on the static event data module for structured content.\n- Routing and layout: The page composes multiple sections; language changes affect all of them uniformly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e NAV[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e LS[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e

and key. It is efficient for typical UI sizes.\n- Re-render scope: Changing the language updates the provider state, causing all consumers to re-render. This is expected and acceptable for a small-scale application.\n- Memoization strategies:\n  - Memoize derived arrays (e.g., agenda lists) inside components if they grow large.\n  - Use React.memo for leaf components that render frequently.\n  - Avoid unnecessary re-computation by passing pre-translated strings to deeply nested components.\n- Asynchronous data migration:\n  - If moving to external APIs, introduce caching and loading states to prevent UI thrashing.\n  - Use a data fetching library with built-in caching and invalidation to minimize redundant requests.\n- Font and directionality:\n  - The app dynamically applies fonts and directionality based on language. Keep this minimal and avoid heavy computations in render paths.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Missing translation keys:\n  - Symptom: Keys fall back to themselves.\n  - Resolution: Ensure keys exist in the translation map for all supported languages.\n- Language switch not updating content:\n  - Symptom: UI remains unchanged after switching language.\n  - Resolution: Verify the provider is wrapping the app and that components call the hook correctly.\n- Mixed language content in hybrid components:\n  - Symptom: Some fields display in a different language than others.\n  - Resolution: Use language-aware selection consistently (as shown in speakers) or rely on translation keys for uniformity.\n- Static data not updating:\n  - Symptom: Event dates/times do not reflect changes.\n  - Resolution: Update the static data module and ensure components re-import the updated values.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe application cleanly separates static event data from dynamic translation data, enabling consistent multilingual rendering across components. The LanguageContext provider centralizes internationalization concerns, while components remain focused on presentation. The rendering lifecycle ensures immediate updates when language changes. For future enhancements—such as migrating to external APIs—the suggested memoization and caching strategies can help maintain responsiveness and data consistency.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-935f3526-cc82-4e50-af3a-47f66794c23c","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":31471,"completion_tokens":3989,"total_tokens":35460,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
