Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the translation system implemented in LanguageContext.tsx. Thoroughly explain the translations object structure with language-specific key-value pairs for UI strings across multiple sections (navigation, hero, details, agenda, etc.). Document the t() function's role in retrieving translations and handling missing keys. Explain how the LanguageProvider uses React Context to manage language state (ar, en, tr) and propagate it throughout the application. Describe the isRTL flag and its impact on layout direction for Arabic language. Provide code examples showing how components consume translations via the useLanguage hook. Address common issues such as untranslated keys, performance implications of large translation objects, and strategies for adding new languages or managing dynamic content translations.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nTranslation System\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers the structure of the translations object, the t() function behavior, the LanguageProvider’s role in managing language state and propagating it via React Context, and the isRTL flag for Arabic layout direction. It also demonstrates how components consume translations using the useLanguage hook, and provides guidance on handling missing keys, performance implications, and strategies for adding new languages or managing dynamic content.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe translation system centers around a single context provider and a small set of consumer components. The provider exposes language state, a translation function, and an RTL flag. Consumers use a simple hook to retrieve translated strings and react to language changes.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Root\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\"]\n    Provider[\"LanguageProvider\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Pages\"\n    Index[\"Index.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"UI Components\"\n    Navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n    Hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n    Details[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"]\n    Agenda[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n    Goals[\"GoalsSection.tsx\"]\n    Speakers[\"SpeakersSection.tsx\"]\n    Orgs[\"OrganizersSection.tsx\"]\n    Footer[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n    LangSwitch[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  App --\u003e Provider\n  Provider --\u003e Index\n  Index --\u003e Navbar\n  Index --\u003e Hero\n  Index --\u003e Details\n  Index --\u003e Agenda\n  Index --\u003e Goals\n  Index --\u003e Speakers\n  Index --\u003e Orgs\n  Index --\u003e Footer\n  Navbar --\u003e LangSwitch\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Core Components\n- LanguageContext.tsx defines:\n  - Language union type with supported languages.\n  - Translations object keyed by language and then by dot-delimited keys.\n  - LanguageProvider that manages language state, exposes t(), and computes isRTL.\n  - useLanguage hook with runtime guard to ensure usage within provider.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n- translations: central dictionary of UI strings grouped by functional sections (navigation, hero, details, agenda, speakers, organizers, footer, venue).\n- t(key): retrieves translation for current language or falls back to the key itself if missing.\n- isRTL: true when language is Arabic, enabling RTL layout direction.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe translation architecture is a minimal, centralized system built on React Context.

While simple lookups are O(1), rendering many components with frequent re-renders can still cause overhead.\n- Memoization strategies:\n  - Wrap frequently used translated strings in useMemo/useCallback where appropriate to prevent unnecessary re-computation.\n  - Consider splitting translations into smaller chunks per route or section to reduce re-renders when switching languages.\n- Dynamic content:\n  - For components with large lists (e.g., speakers), localize only the visible subset or virtualize lists to minimize DOM and re-render costs.\n- Font and layout:\n  - Applying dir and fonts at the root reduces layout thrashing compared to applying per component.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Untranslated keys:\n  - Symptom: Keys appear as-is in UI.\n  - Cause: Missing key in translations object.\n  - Resolution: Add the key to all languages in the translations object. The t() function returns the key itself if missing, which helps surface missing entries quickly.\n- Incorrect layout direction:\n  - Symptom: Text alignment or component ordering looks wrong for Arabic.\n  - Cause: isRTL not applied consistently.\n  - Resolution: Ensure dir is set on the root container and on containers that host inline directional content. The App.tsx applies dir based on isRTL; Navbar.tsx also applies dir locally.\n- LanguageSwitcher not updating:\n  - Symptom: Clicking a language does not change text.\n  - Resolution: Verify LanguageSwitcher calls setLanguage and that components re-render after state changes.\n- Mixed-language content in dynamic lists:\n  - Symptom: Speaker names or roles show incorrect language.\n  - Resolution: Use language-aware getters in components like SpeakersSection.tsx to select the correct localized field based on current language.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe translation system is intentionally simple and robust: a centralized provider supplies language state, a translation function, and an RTL flag. Components consume translations via a straightforward hook, and the app applies layout direction globally. This design minimizes complexity while enabling easy maintenance and extension. To add a new language, extend the translations object and update LanguageSwitcher options. For dynamic content, prefer language-aware getters or memoization to keep performance predictable.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-7814a936-9af0-4971-a6b2-d6d11028be14","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":33601,"completion_tokens":3790,"total_tokens":37391,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
