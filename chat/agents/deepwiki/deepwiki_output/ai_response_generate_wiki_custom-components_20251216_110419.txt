Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the custom components used in the application. Focus on components such as HeroSection, AgendaSection, SpeakersSection, and RegistrationSection that are specific to the event platform. Document each component's purpose, props interface, and integration with the global state (especially language context). Provide real-world usage examples from the Index page, explain how data flows from eventData.ts into these components, and detail their responsive behavior across devices. Include accessibility considerations, animation patterns, and internationalization support (RTL for Arabic). Address common implementation issues such as language context propagation, scroll-to-top integration, and mobile responsiveness. Highlight performance optimization techniques like lazy loading or memoization if applicable.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nCustom Components\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It explains each component’s purpose, props interface, integration with the global language context, real-world usage from the Index page, data flow from eventData.ts, responsive behavior, accessibility considerations, animation patterns, internationalization support (including RTL for Arabic), and performance optimization techniques. It also addresses common implementation issues such as language context propagation, scroll-to-top integration, and mobile responsiveness.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe event platform is organized around a page-driven layout where the Index page composes multiple sections. Global state is managed via a LanguageProvider that supplies translation keys and directionality. Components consume the language context to render localized content and adapt layouts accordingly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Shell\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\"]\n    LangProv[\"LanguageProvider\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Pages\"\n    Index[\"Index.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Sections\"\n    Hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n    Agenda[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n    Speakers[\"SpeakersSection.tsx\"]\n    Reg[\"RegistrationSection.tsx\"]\n    Countdown[\"CountdownTimer.tsx\"]\n    ScrollTop[\"ScrollToTop.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  App --\u003e LangProv\n  App --\u003e Index\n  Index --\u003e Hero\n  Index --\u003e Agenda\n  Index --\u003e Speakers\n  Index --\u003e Reg\n  Hero --\u003e Countdown\n  App --\u003e ScrollTop\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Core Components\nThis section introduces the four custom components and their roles within the event platform.\n\n- HeroSection: The hero section showcases the event identity with decorative elements, a countdown timer, and a call-to-action anchor to the “Why” section. It relies on the language context for all text content and uses Tailwind utilities for responsive design and animations.\n- AgendaSection: Presents the event program as a grid of cards, each containing a time slot, title, description, and icon. It translates content via the language context and adapts layout across breakpoints.\n- SpeakersSection: Displays featured speakers with multilingual names and roles. It selects the appropriate language for display and falls back gracefully if images are missing.\n- RegistrationSection: Provides a QR code and registration link with localized copy and a prominent call-to-action button. It dynamically chooses localized text based on the current language.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe components integrate with the global language context and are composed by the Index page. The App shell wraps the application with providers that supply language, directionality, routing, and UI utilities.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant App as \"App.tsx\"\n  participant Lang as \"LanguageProvider\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant Page as \"Index.tsx\"\n  participant Hero as \"HeroSection.tsx\"\n  participant Agenda as \"AgendaSection.tsx\"\n  participant Speakers as \"SpeakersSection.tsx\"\n  participant Reg as \"RegistrationSection.tsx\"\n  participant Countdown as \"CountdownTimer.tsx\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eApp: Load \"/\"\n  App-\u003e\u003eLang: Provide language, t(), isRTL\n  App-\u003e\u003ePage: Render Index\n  Page-\u003e\u003eHero: Render\n  Hero-\u003e\u003eCountdown: Render\n  Page-\u003e\u003eAgenda: Render\n  Page-\u003e\u003eSpeakers: Render\n  Page-\u003e\u003eReg: Render\n  Note over App,Page: All components consume useLanguage()\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### HeroSection\nPurpose:\n- Establishes the hero identity with decorative imagery, animated confetti, and a countdown timer.\n- Provides a smooth scroll anchor to the “Why” section.\n\nProps interface:\n- None.
