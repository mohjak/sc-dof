Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the navigation components including Navbar and ScrollToTop. Describe the Navbar's responsive design with desktop and mobile menu states, its integration with the LanguageSwitcher, and how it uses hash-based navigation via scrollIntoView to navigate to page sections. Explain the implementation of smooth scrolling with preventDefault and the scrollToSection utility function. Detail the mobile menu toggle functionality using state and click handlers, and the visual feedback through Lucide icons (Menu/X). For ScrollToTop, explain the visibility logic based on scroll position (300px threshold), the smooth scrolling behavior, and the animated appearance/disappearance using Tailwind classes and transform transitions. Include examples of event handling, state management with useState and useEffect, and a11y practices like aria-labels. Address common issues such as scroll position conflicts, mobile touch interactions, and performance of scroll event listeners, providing optimization tips like debouncing if necessary.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nNavigation Components\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It focuses on:\n- Navbar: responsive design with desktop and mobile menu states, integration with LanguageSwitcher, and hash-based navigation using scrollIntoView for smooth scrolling.\n- ScrollToTop: visibility logic based on scroll position, smooth scrolling behavior, and animated appearance/disappearance using Tailwind classes and transform transitions.\n\nIt also covers state management with useState and useEffect, event handling, accessibility practices (aria-labels), and performance considerations such as scroll listener optimization.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe navigation components are integrated into the main page layout and rely on shared internationalization and styling utilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Pages\"\n    Index[\"Index.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Components\"\n    Navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n    ScrollToTop[\"ScrollToTop.tsx\"]\n    LangSwitcher[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Contexts\"\n    LangCtx[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Styling\"\n    CSS[\"index.css\"]\n    Utils[\"utils.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  App[\"App.tsx\"]\n\n  App --\u003e Index\n  Index --\u003e Navbar\n  Index --\u003e ScrollToTop\n  Navbar --\u003e LangSwitcher\n  Navbar --\u003e LangCtx\n  LangSwitcher --\u003e LangCtx\n  Navbar --\u003e CSS\n  ScrollToTop --\u003e CSS\n  Navbar --\u003e Utils\n  ScrollToTop --\u003e Utils\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L130-L142)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Core Components\n- Navbar: Fixed header with logo, desktop navigation links, mobile menu toggle, and LanguageSwitcher integration. Uses hash-based navigation via scrollIntoView and preventDefault to smoothly scroll to sections.\n- ScrollToTop: Floating button that appears when the user scrolls beyond a threshold, enabling smooth scroll-to-top with animated transitions.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe Navbar and ScrollToTop components are composed within the main Index page. Navbar listens to scroll events to update its visual state and manages mobile menu visibility. Both components rely on the LanguageContext for i18n and directionality, and on Tailwind utilities for styling and transitions.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Navbar as \"Navbar.tsx\"\n  participant Lang as \"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"\n  participant LangCtx as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant Page as \"Index.tsx\"\n  participant Window as \"Window\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Click desktop/mobile link\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eNavbar: preventDefault()\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eWindow: scrollToSection(href) -\u003e scrollIntoView({ behavior: \"smooth\" })\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eLang: Render LanguageSwitcher (variant=\"navbar\")\n  Lang-\u003e\u003eLangCtx: useLanguage()\n  LangCtx--\u003e\u003eLang: language, t(), isRTL\n  Navbar--\u003e\u003ePage: Renders sections below\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L76)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Navbar Component\nResponsibilities:\n- Manage scroll-based visual effect (background blur and shadow) when scrolling down.\n- Provide desktop and mobile navigation with hash-based routing to page sections.\n- Integrate LanguageSwitcher and reflect RTL/LTR directionality.\n- Toggle mobile menu with state and render Lucide icons (Menu/X) for visual feedback.\n\nKey behaviors:\n- Scroll detection: useEffect adds a scroll listener to update a state flag when scroll position exceeds a threshold. Cleanup removes the listener on unmount.\n- Hash-based navigation: Each link’s click handler prevents default anchor behavior and calls a utility function to scroll to the target section using scrollIntoView with smooth behavior.\n- Mobile menu: State toggles visibility of the mobile navigation panel; clicking a mobile link also triggers the same scroll utility and closes the menu.\n- Accessibility: The mobile menu toggle button includes an aria-label for screen readers.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Navbar mount\"]) --\u003e AddListener[\"Add scroll listener\"]\n  AddListener --\u003e ScrollDown{\"Scroll \u003e threshold?\"}\n  ScrollDown --\u003e|Yes| SetScrolled[\"Set scrolled=true\"]\n  ScrollDown --\u003e|No| SetScrolledOff[\"Set scrolled=false\"]\n  SetScrolled --\u003e Render[\"Render with backdrop blur and shadow\"]\n  SetScrolledOff --\u003e Render\n  Render --\u003e ClickLink{\"User clicks nav link?\"}\n  ClickLink --\u003e|Desktop/Mobile| PreventDefault[\"preventDefault()\"]\n  PreventDefault --\u003e ScrollTo[\"scrollToSection(href)\"]\n  ScrollTo --\u003e Smooth[\"scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })\"]\n  Smooth --\u003e CloseMenu[\"Close mobile menu (if open)\"]\n  CloseMenu --\u003e End([\"Done\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L11-L17)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L76)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L95-L116)\n\nImplementation highlights:\n- State and effects: useState for scrolled and mobile menu state; useEffect for scroll listener and cleanup.\n- Event handling: preventDefault on anchor clicks; click handlers for mobile menu toggle and navigation links.\n- Styling: Tailwind classes adjust background, backdrop blur, shadow, and transitions based on scroll state.\n- Internationalization: uses LanguageContext for labels and directionality; passes isRTL to the nav container.\n- Icons: Lucide Menu/X rendered conditionally based on mobile menu state.\n\nAccessibility:\n- aria-label on the mobile menu toggle button.\n- Semantic anchor elements for navigation.\n\nIntegration points:\n- LanguageSwitcher is rendered in both desktop and mobile contexts.\n- Uses t() from LanguageContext for localized labels.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L130-L142)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n### ScrollToTop Component\nResponsibilities:\n- Show a floating button when the user scrolls beyond a threshold.\n- Smoothly scroll to the top of the page when clicked.\n- Animate visibility using Tailwind classes with opacity and transform transitions.\n\nKey behaviors:\n- Visibility logic: useEffect adds a scroll listener that updates a state flag when scroll position exceeds the threshold. Cleanup removes the listener on unmount.\n- Smooth scrolling: onClick triggers window.scrollTo with smooth behavior.\n- Animated appearance/disappearance: Conditional Tailwind classes control opacity and translate-y; pointer-events-none hides interactions when not visible.\n- Accessibility: aria-label on the button.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Mount ScrollToTop\"]) --\u003e AddScroll[\"Add scroll listener\"]\n  AddScroll --\u003e CheckPos{\"window.scrollY \u003e threshold?\"}\n  CheckPos --\u003e|Yes| Show[\"Set isVisible=true\"]\n  CheckPos --\u003e|No| Hide[\"Set isVisible=false\"]\n  Show --\u003e Render[\"Render with opacity and transform visible\"]\n  Hide --\u003e RenderHidden[\"Render with opacity 0 and translate-y-10\u003cbr/\u003epointer-events-none\"]\n  Render --\u003e Click[\"User clicks button\"]\n  Click --\u003e ScrollTop[\"window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })\"]\n  ScrollTop --\u003e End([\"Done\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L130-L142)\n\n### LanguageSwitcher Integration\n- Navbar renders LanguageSwitcher in both desktop and mobile contexts.\n- LanguageSwitcher reads current language and directionality from LanguageContext and exposes buttons to switch languages.\n- The Navbar passes variant=\"navbar\" to align styling with the navigation bar.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L78-L116)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Navbar depends on:\n  - LanguageContext for labels and directionality.\n  - Lucide icons for mobile menu toggle.\n  - Tailwind classes for responsive layout and visual effects.\n  - ScrollToTop is independent but both share the scroll listener pattern.\n- ScrollToTop depends on:\n  - Window scroll events.\n  - Tailwind classes for animation and visibility.\n- LanguageSwitcher depends on:\n  - LanguageContext for language state and translation keys.\n  - Optional flags/emojis for language indicators.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"] --\u003e LangCtx[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  Navbar --\u003e LangSwitcher[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  Navbar --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  ScrollToTop[\"ScrollToTop.tsx\"] --\u003e CSS\n  Navbar --\u003e Utils[\"utils.ts\"]\n  ScrollToTop --\u003e Utils\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L130-L142)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L130-L142)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Scroll listeners: Both Navbar and ScrollToTop attach scroll listeners in useEffect. Ensure cleanup removes listeners to prevent memory leaks.\n- Debouncing/throttling: For frequent scroll events, consider debouncing the visibility toggle in ScrollToTop to reduce re-renders and improve performance on lower-end devices.\n- Smooth scrolling: Using scrollIntoView with smooth behavior is convenient but can be heavy on complex pages. Consider virtualization or limiting DOM updates in sections if performance becomes an issue.\n- CSS transitions: Excessive transforms and opacity changes can cause layout thrashing. Keep transitions minimal and prefer transform/opacity combinations.\n- Accessibility: aria-labels and keyboard-friendly navigation are essential.
