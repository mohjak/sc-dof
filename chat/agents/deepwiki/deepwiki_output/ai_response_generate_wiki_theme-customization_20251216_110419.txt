Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for theme customization focused on the CSS variables and utility classes system. Explain how the :root CSS variables in index.css enable dynamic theming with light/dark mode support and how they're referenced in Tailwind classes via hsl(var(--color)) syntax. Detail the custom utility classes like .glass, .gradient-hero, and animation utilities (.animate-float, .animate-pulse-glow) that extend Tailwind's capabilities. Describe how the cn() utility function from utils.ts enables conditional class composition for theme variations. Provide examples from components like LanguageSwitcher that use backdrop-blur effects or cards with custom shadows. Include guidance on adding new theme colors, modifying gradients, and creating custom animation patterns while maintaining design consistency.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nTheme Customization\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

Dark mode toggles these variables under a .dark selector.\n- Tailwind resolves these variables into Tailwind color utilities using hsl(var(--token)) declarations.\n- Custom utilities in index.css provide reusable patterns for gradients, glass morphism, and glow effects.\n- Animation utilities define keyframes and apply them to Tailwind-like classes for motion.\n- cn() merges conditional class names safely, preventing conflicts and ensuring predictable overrides.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L20-L128)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n-

CSS Variables and Dark Mode\n- The :root block defines a complete color palette using HSL values for background, foreground, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, borders, inputs, and ring.\n- Custom brand tokens (e.g., syrian-red, syrian-green, gold, cream) and gradients (e.g., hero, gold, green) are declared here.\n- Radius and shadow tokens standardize corner rounding and elevation effects.\n- The .dark block redefines all variables for dark mode, ensuring consistent contrast and readability.\n\nPractical implications:\n- Changing a single variable updates all derived utilities and components automatically.\n- Dark mode is controlled by applying the .dark class to the root element (via Tailwind’s darkMode setting).\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L20-L128)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n### Tailwind Color Resolution via hsl(var(--token))\n- Tailwind maps each semantic color to a CSS variable using hsl(var(--token)).\n- Extended color groups (syrian, gold, cream, sidebar) are exposed for granular control.\n- Border radius and keyframe-driven animations are configured to consume CSS variables.\n\nEffects:\n- Components can use Tailwind classes like text-primary, bg-syrian-green, and shadow-lg without hardcoding values.\n- Accordion animations leverage a CSS variable for content height.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n### Custom Utility Classes\n- Gradient utilities: .gradient-hero, .gradient-gold, .gradient-green, and .text-gradient provide consistent hero and text treatments.\n- Glass effect: .glass applies a translucent background with backdrop blur and border for frosted-glass UIs.\n- Glow utilities: .glow-primary and .glow-gold add luminous halos around elements.\n- These utilities resolve colors from CSS variables, keeping them in sync with the theme.\n\nUsage examples:\n- HeroSection uses .glass and .gradient-gold for the CTA and date badge.\n- LanguageSwitcher uses .glass and backdrop blur for floating controls.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L172)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L74-L93)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L19-L41)\n\n### Animation Utilities and Staggered Delays\n- Keyframes define float, pulse-glow, shimmer, fade-up, scale-in, and confetti-fall.\n- Tailwind-like classes (.animate-float, .animate-pulse-glow, .animate-shimmer, .animate-fade-up, .animate-scale-in, .animate-confetti) bind these animations.\n- Staggered delays (.delay-100 through .delay-500) enable choreographed entrance sequences.\n\nUsage examples:\n- HeroSection animates the eagle emblem and tagline with .animate-float and .animate-fade-up.\n- HeroSection decoratively animates confetti particles with .animate-confetti and random colors from CSS variables.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L174-L249)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L20-L33)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L36-L68)\n\n### Conditional Class Composition with cn()\n- The cn() utility merges clsx inputs and deduplicates conflicting Tailwind classes using tailwind-merge.\n- Components pass conditional class strings to cn(), ensuring only one variant is active at a time.\n\nUsage examples:\n- Card component composes rounded corners, borders, background, and text color with cn().\n- LanguageSwitcher conditionally applies active/inactive states and hover effects.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L10)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L20-L41)\n\n### Example Components Using Theme Tokens\n- LanguageSwitcher:\n  - Uses .glass and backdrop blur for a floating control panel.\n  - Applies text-syrian-green and hover states that respect theme variables.\n- HeroSection:\n  - Uses .glass and .gradient-gold for the CTA and date badge.\n  - Applies .animate-float and .animate-fade-up for motion.\n  - Randomly colors confetti using hsl(var(--syrian-red)), hsl(var(--syrian-green)), and hsl(var(--gold)).\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L19-L41)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L36-L93)\n\n### Adding New Theme Colors\nSteps:\n1. Add a new CSS variable in :root (e.g., --brand-purple).\n2. Optionally add a gradient or shadow token referencing the new variable.\n3. Register the color in tailwind.config.ts under theme.extend.colors.\n4. Use Tailwind classes (e.g., text-brand-purple, bg-brand-purple) in components.\n5. Compose conditional classes with cn() to switch between themes.\n\nGuidance:\n- Keep HSL values consistent with the existing palette to preserve contrast and accessibility.\n- Prefer semantic names (e.g., brand-* or status-*) to avoid confusion.\n- Test both light and dark modes to ensure readability.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L20-L128)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n### Modifying Gradients\nSteps:\n1. Update the gradient variable in :root (e.g., --gradient-hero).\n2. Update the corresponding utility class in index.css if needed.\n3. Reference the utility class in components (e.g., .gradient-hero).\n4. Verify both light and dark mode gradients adapt to theme changes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L69-L73)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L144-L154)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L84-L93)\n\n### Creating Custom Animation Patterns\nSteps:\n1. Define a new keyframe in index.css.\n2. Create a Tailwind-like class that binds the keyframe and sets timing/easing.\n3. Optionally add staggered delay utilities for choreography.\n4. Apply the class to components and combine with other theme utilities.\n\nBest practices:\n- Keep durations and easing consistent with existing animations.\n- Use staggered delays sparingly to avoid overwhelming users.\n- Prefer subtle motion to maintain accessibility.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L174-L249)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L36-L68)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nThe theme system depends on:\n- index.css for CSS variables and utilities\n- tailwind.config.ts for color resolution and extensions\n- utils.ts for safe class composition\n- Components that consume Tailwind classes and utilities\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Vars[\"CSS Variables\u003cbr/\u003e:root\"] --\u003e TW[\"Tailwind Colors\"]\n  TW --\u003e Comp[\"Components\"]\n  Utils[\"cn()\"] --\u003e Comp\n  Entry[\"main.tsx\"] --\u003e Styles[\"index.css\"]\n  Entry --\u003e Comp\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L20-L128)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L20-L128)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- CSS variables reduce duplication and improve maintainability; Tailwind’s JIT compilation ensures only used utilities are generated.\n- Avoid excessive use of backdrop blur and heavy shadows on low-end devices; prefer .glass and glow sparingly.\n- Keep animation durations moderate to prevent jank on mobile devices.\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Colors not updating in dark mode:\n  - Ensure the .dark selector is present and variables are redefined.\n  - Confirm dark mode is toggled at the root level.\n- Gradient or glow not visible:\n  - Verify the gradient variable and utility class are defined.\n  - Check that the component applies the correct utility class.\n- Conflicting classes:\n  - Use cn() to merge conditional classes; it prevents duplicates and ensures precedence.\n- Animation not playing:\n  - Confirm the keyframe and class are defined.\n  - Ensure the component applies the animation class and that the element is visible.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L20-L128)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L249)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe theme system centers on a single source of truth: CSS variables in :root. Tailwind consumes these variables to expose semantic color classes, while custom utilities and animations provide cohesive design patterns. The cn() utility ensures predictable class composition. By following the steps outlined, you can extend the palette, adjust gradients, and introduce new animations while maintaining consistency across light and dark modes.\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Quick Reference: Theme Tokens and Utilities\n- CSS Variables: background, foreground, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, border, input, ring, radius, custom brand colors, gradients, shadows, sidebar tokens\n- Tailwind Colors: border, input, ring, background, foreground, primary, secondary, destructive, muted, accent, popover, card, syrian.*, gold.*, cream, sidebar.*\n- Utilities: .gradient-hero, .gradient-gold, .gradient-green, .text-gradient, .glass, .glow-primary, .glow-gold\n- Animations: .animate-float, .animate-pulse-glow, .animate-shimmer, .animate-fade-up, .animate-scale-in, .animate-confetti\n- Staggered Delays: .delay-100, .delay-200, .delay-300, .delay-400, .delay-500\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L20-L128)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-61a71fcc-7b91-4755-8e7f-a410f8888a70","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":37949,"completion_tokens":3466,"total_tokens":41415,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
