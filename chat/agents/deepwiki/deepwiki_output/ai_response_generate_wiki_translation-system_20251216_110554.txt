Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the translation system focused on the multilingual content management in the sc-dof platform. Thoroughly explain the implementation of the translations object in LanguageContext.tsx, which contains a comprehensive dictionary of localized strings for Arabic, English, and Turkish, organized by functional areas (navigation, hero, details, agenda, etc.) using a dot-notation key structure. Document how the t() function serves as the primary interface for components to retrieve translated strings, including its fallback mechanism that returns the key itself if a translation is missing. Explain the process of adding new translation keys and maintaining consistency across languages. Provide concrete examples from the codebase showing translation keys in use, such as 'nav.home', 'hero.title', and 'agenda.1.title'. Describe how the LanguageSwitcher component triggers language changes that automatically update all translated content throughout the application. Address common issues like missing translations, inconsistent terminology, and handling dynamic content within translations. Include best practices for organizing translation keys, maintaining linguistic consistency, and ensuring complete coverage across all languages.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nTranslation System\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It focuses on the LanguageContext implementation, the t() translation function, the dot-notation key structure, and how LanguageSwitcher drives language changes that propagate instantly to all components. It also covers best practices for organizing translation keys, maintaining consistency, and handling dynamic content safely.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe translation system is centered around a React Context provider and a small set of components that consume it. The provider exposes:\n- language: current language code\n- setLanguage: function to change language\n- t: translation function keyed by dot notation\n- isRTL: boolean indicating right-to-left layout for Arabic\n\nKey files:\n- Provider and translation logic: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n- Language switcher UI: [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx)\n- Application shell applying direction and fonts: [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx)\n- Page composition: [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx)\n- Example components consuming translations: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx), [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx), [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx), [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx), [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx)\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Shell\"\n    APP[\"App.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Context Layer\"\n    LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageProvider, t(), isRTL\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"UI Layer\"\n    IDX[\"Index.tsx\"]\n    NAV[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n    HERO[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n    AGENDA[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n    DETAILS[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"]\n    FOOTER[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n    SWITCH[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  APP --\u003e LC\n  LC --\u003e IDX\n  IDX --\u003e NAV\n  IDX --\u003e HERO\n  IDX --\u003e AGENDA\n  IDX --\u003e DETAILS\n  IDX --\u003e FOOTER\n  NAV --\u003e SWITCH\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Core Components\n- LanguageContext.tsx\n  - Defines the Language union type and the LanguageContextType interface.\n  - Provides the LanguageProvider that manages language state and exposes t() and isRTL.\n  - Implements the translations dictionary with keys grouped by functional areas (nav, hero, details, goals, agenda, speakers, organizers, footer, venue).\n  -

Language union: 'ar' | 'en' | 'tr'\n  - translations: nested object keyed by language, then by dot-notation keys\n  - t(key): returns translations[language][key] or falls back to key\n  - isRTL: true for Arabic\n- Provider behavior:\n  - Initializes language to Arabic\n  - Exposes t() and isRTL to consumers\n  - Throws if useLanguage is used outside provider\n- Dot-notation key groups:\n  - Navigation: nav.home, nav.why, nav.goals, nav.details, nav.agenda, nav.speakers, nav.organizers, nav.register\n  - Hero: hero.title, hero.subtitle, hero.tagline, hero.discoverMore, hero.date, hero.day\n  - Details: details.title, details.date, details.time, details.location, details.evening, details.viewMap, event.time\n  - Goals: goals.title, goals.1.title, goals.1.description, ... up to goals.4.*\n  - Agenda: agenda.title, agenda.subtitle, agenda.1.time..7.time, agenda.1.title..7.title, agenda.1.description..7.description\n  - Speakers, Organizers, Footer, Venue: speakers.*, organizers.*, footer.*, venue.*\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class LanguageContextType {\n    +language: Language\n    +setLanguage(lang): void\n    +t(key): string\n    +isRTL: boolean\n  }\n\n  class LanguageProvider {\n    +useState(language)\n    +t(key): string\n    +isRTL: boolean\n  }\n\n  LanguageProvider --\u003e LanguageContextType : \"provides\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n- Purpose: UI to switch languages and reflect current selection.\n- Behavior:\n  -

All components depend on LanguageContext via useLanguage\n  - LanguageSwitcher depends on LanguageContext to change language\n  - App.tsx depends on isRTL to set direction and fonts\n- Internal dependencies:\n  - t() depends on translations dictionary and current language\n  - setLanguage updates state, causing re-renders across the tree\n- No circular dependencies detected among these files.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e NAV[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e HERO[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e AG[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e DET[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e FOOT[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n  SWITCH[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"] --\u003e LC\n  APP[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e LC\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Minimal re-renders: The provider updates a single state field; consumers only re-render when language changes.\n- Avoid unnecessary recomputation: Keep translation keys stable and avoid constructing keys dynamically inside loops unless needed.\n- Large dictionaries: The current dictionary is compact; if expanded, consider lazy-loading or splitting translations by route/page to reduce initial payload.\n- Memoization: For expensive computed strings, memoize at the component level if needed, but t() itself is O(1).\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Missing translations\n  - Symptom: Keys appear as-is in UI (fallback behavior)\n  - Resolution: Add the key to all languages in the translations object\n  - Reference: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L272-L274)\n- Inconsistent terminology\n  - Symptom: Same concept appears differently across languages\n  - Resolution: Define canonical keys and review across languages; keep dot-notation grouping consistent\n  - Reference: Functional areas like nav.*, hero.*, agenda.* in [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L264)\n- Dynamic content within translations\n  - Symptom: Need to insert variables into translated strings\n  - Resolution: Use a templating approach outside t() (e.g., pass variables to a helper that substitutes placeholders) or split translatable parts and concatenate safely\n  - Reference: t() returns raw strings; no built-in interpolation in [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L272-L274)\n- Mixed-language text alignment\n  - Symptom: Mixed RTL/LTR text causes layout issues\n  - Resolution: Ensure isRTL is applied consistently; wrap mixed-content containers with appropriate direction classes\n  - Reference: App.tsx sets direction based on isRTL [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n- LanguageSwitcher not updating content\n  - Symptom: Clicking buttons does nothing\n  - Resolution: Verify LanguageProvider wraps the app and components; confirm useLanguage is used inside provider\n  - References: [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L33-L41), [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L39), [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L285-L291)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L272-L274)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L39)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe sc-dof translation system is a minimal, robust solution that centralizes localization in a single provider and exposes a simple t() function. The dot-notation key structure organizes content by functional areas, and LanguageSwitcher provides immediate, global updates across the UI. By following the best practices below, teams can maintain consistency, avoid missing translations, and scale the system as needed.\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Best Practices for Translation Keys\n- Group by functional areas using dot notation (nav.*, hero.*, agenda.*, etc.)\n- Keep keys stable and avoid dynamic construction inside loops\n- Maintain parity across languages; add missing keys to all languages\n- Use canonical terminology and avoid ambiguous phrasing\n- Prefer short, descriptive keys that clearly indicate context and purpose\n\n### Adding New Translation Keys\nSteps:\n1. Choose a dot-notation key under the appropriate functional area\n2. Add the key to all languages in the translations object\n3. Import useLanguage in the component and call t(\"your.new.key\")\n4. Test language switching to ensure the new key renders correctly\n5. Verify directionality and fonts remain consistent\n\nReferences:\n- Translations object and t() fallback: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L274)\n- Consumer usage examples: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L19-L28), [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L47-L58), [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L8-L16), [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L28-L56), [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L90-L93)\n\n### Example Keys in Use\n- Navigation: \"nav.home\", \"nav.why\", \"nav.goals\", \"nav.details\", \"nav.agenda\", \"nav.speakers\", \"nav.organizers\", \"nav.register\"\n- Hero: \"hero.title\", \"hero.subtitle\", \"hero.tagline\", \"hero.discoverMore\", \"hero.date\", \"hero.day\"\n- Details: \"details.title\", \"details.date\", \"details.time\", \"details.location\", \"details.evening\", \"details.viewMap\", \"event.time\"\n- Goals: \"goals.title\", \"goals.1.title\", \"goals.1.description\", \"goals.2.title\", \"goals.2.description\", \"goals.3.title\", \"goals.3.description\", \"goals.4.title\", \"goals.4.description\"\n- Agenda: \"agenda.title\", \"agenda.subtitle\", \"agenda.1.time\" through \"agenda.7.time\", \"agenda.1.title\" through \"agenda.7.title\", \"agenda.1.description\" through \"agenda.7.description\"\n- Speakers, Organizers, Footer, Venue: \"speakers.*\", \"organizers.*\", \"footer.*\", \"venue.*\"\n\nReferences:\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L264)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L19-L28)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L47-L58)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L8-L16)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L28-L56)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L90-L93)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-c95e6c88-5a38-4ce6-a6ff-0566685680b2","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":30420,"completion_tokens":4897,"total_tokens":35317,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
