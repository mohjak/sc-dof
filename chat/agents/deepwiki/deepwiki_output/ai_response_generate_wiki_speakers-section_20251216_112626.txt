Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the SpeakersSection component that showcases event participants through a responsive grid of profile cards. Explain its implementation with a typed Speaker interface, multilingual name and role handling through language-specific properties, and conditional image rendering. Document how it uses the getName and getRole helper functions to display content based on the current language context. Describe the responsive grid layout (1-2-3-4 columns) and animation sequence where cards fade in with staggered delays. Include details on the card design with circular image containers, hover effects, and ring decorations. Address common issues like missing speaker images and text overflow in role descriptions. Provide guidance on adding new speakers, managing image assets, and customizing the section's layout and animations.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nSpeakers Section\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers the typed Speaker interface, multilingual name and role handling, conditional image rendering, responsive grid layout, and the animated entrance sequence. It also describes the card design, hover effects, ring decorations, and guidance for adding new speakers, managing assets, and customizing layout and animations.\n\n## Project Structure\nSpeakersSection is located under the components directory and integrates with the global language context for translations and RTL support. The component imports localized strings for the section title and subtitle and uses Tailwind classes for layout and animations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Components\"\n    SS[\"SpeakersSection.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Contexts\"\n    LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Styles\"\n    CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  end\n\n  SS --\u003e LC\n  SS --\u003e CSS\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L160-L249)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L160-L249)\n\n## Core Components\n- Typed Speaker interface: Defines fields for identifiers, multilingual names, multilingual roles, and an optional image URL.\n- Multilingual selection helpers: getName and getRole pick the appropriate field based on the current language context.\n- Responsive grid: Uses Tailwind’s grid utilities to adapt from 1 to 4 columns across breakpoints.\n- Animation sequence: Cards fade in with a staggered delay to create a pleasing entrance.\n- Card design: Circular image container with ring decoration, hover effects, and typography hierarchy.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L18-L27)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L185)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L199-L231)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L190-L241)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe component reads the current language and translation function from the LanguageContext, selects the appropriate name and role fields, and renders a grid of cards. Each card applies a fade-up animation with a staggered delay. The animation keyframes and utilities are defined in the global stylesheet.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Provider as \"LanguageProvider\"\n  participant Context as \"useLanguage()\"\n  participant Comp as \"SpeakersSection\"\n  participant Grid as \"Grid Container\"\n  participant Card as \"Card Item\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eProvider: \"App initializes provider\"\n  Provider--\u003e\u003eComp: \"Provide {language, t}\"\n  Comp-\u003e\u003eContext: \"useLanguage()\"\n  Context--\u003e\u003eComp: \"{language, t}\"\n  Comp-\u003e\u003eComp: \"getName(speaker), getRole(speaker)\"\n  Comp-\u003e\u003eGrid: \"Render grid with cards\"\n  Grid-\u003e\u003eCard: \"Each card with animation-delay\"\n  Card--\u003e\u003eUser: \"Displays profile with image/name/role\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L185)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L199-L231)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L190-L241)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Typed Speaker Interface\nThe Speaker interface defines:\n- Identifier and multilingual name fields\n- Multilingual role fields\n- Optional image URL\n\nThis structure enables consistent data handling and ensures type safety when selecting localized content.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L18-L27)\n\n### Multilingual Name and Role Handling\nThe component uses two helper functions:\n- getName: Selects name based on the current language (Arabic by default, with English and Turkish options).\n- getRole: Selects role based on the current language.\n\nThese functions rely on the language context provided by the LanguageContext.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L185)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n\n### Conditional Image Rendering\nEach card conditionally renders either:\n- A speaker image if available\n- A fallback avatar with a placeholder icon if no image is provided\n\nAlt text is generated from the selected name to ensure accessibility.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L208-L219)\n\n### Responsive Grid Layout (1–2–3–4 Columns)\nThe grid adapts across breakpoints:\n- 1 column on small screens\n- 2 columns on medium screens\n- 3 columns on large screens\n- 4 columns on extra-large screens\n\nSpacing is controlled via a consistent gap between cards.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L199-L200)\n\n### Animation Sequence and Staggered Delays\nCards apply a fade-up animation with a staggered delay. The delay increases incrementally per card index, creating a cascading effect.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Render Speaker Grid\"]) --\u003e ForEach[\"Iterate speakers with index\"]\n  ForEach --\u003e ComputeDelay[\"Compute animation-delay = index * 50ms\"]\n  ComputeDelay --\u003e ApplyDelay[\"Apply delay to card element\"]\n  ApplyDelay --\u003e Animate[\"Animate with fade-up keyframes\"]\n  Animate --\u003e End([\"Cards appear in sequence\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L202-L206)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L190-L241)\n\n### Card Design, Hover Effects, and Ring Decorations\n- Card container: Rounded corners, border, subtle background, and hover enhancements (border and shadow).\n- Circular image container: Fixed size with rounded-full and overflow-hidden to crop images into a circle.\n- Ring decoration: A primary-colored ring around the image container with hover expansion.\n- Typography: Bold name and muted role text with relaxed line height for readability.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L202-L227)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L190-L241)\n\n### Accessibility and Internationalization Notes\n- Alt text for images is derived from the selected name, ensuring meaningful alternatives.\n- The component uses the translation function to localize the section title and subtitle.\n- The language context determines directionality and language selection for names and roles.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L190-L197)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L211-L214)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nSpeakersSection depends on:\n- LanguageContext for language and translation\n- Global animation keyframes and utilities for the fade-up effect\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e SS[\"SpeakersSection.tsx\"]\n  CSS[\"index.css\"] --\u003e SS\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L160-L249)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L160-L249)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Image optimization: Ensure speaker images are appropriately sized and compressed to minimize load times.\n- Lazy loading: Consider deferring offscreen images to improve initial render performance.\n- Animation performance: Keep animation durations and easing lightweight; avoid heavy transforms on many elements simultaneously.\n- Asset bundling: Place images under the assets directory and import them as static assets to leverage build-time optimization.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Missing speaker images\n  - Symptom: Placeholder avatar appears instead of a photo.\n  - Resolution: Add an image URL for the speaker or ensure the asset path is correct and the image is present.\n  - Reference: Conditional rendering for image vs fallback.\n  - Section sources\n    - [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L208-L219)\n\n- Text overflow in role descriptions\n  - Symptom: Long role text wraps awkwardly or clips unexpectedly.\n  - Resolution: Adjust line height or consider truncating long roles. Ensure adequate spacing around the text.\n  - Section sources\n    - [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L224-L226)\n\n- Incorrect language selection\n  - Symptom: Names or roles display in the wrong language.\n  - Resolution: Verify the current language in the LanguageContext and ensure translation keys exist for the selected language.\n  - Section sources\n    - [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L185)\n    - [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n\n- Animation not triggering\n  - Symptom: Cards appear instantly without fade-up effect.\n  - Resolution: Confirm the animation keyframes and utility classes are included and that the delay is applied to each card.\n  - Section sources\n    - [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L202-L206)\n    - [index.css](file://src/index.css#L190-L241)\n\n## Conclusion\nSpeakersSection delivers a clean, responsive, and accessible showcase of event participants.
