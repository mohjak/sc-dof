Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive data model documentation for the eventData object defined in eventData.ts.

It focuses on the central event data object exported from the data module and explains how each field contributes to the user experience across key UI sections. It also covers the translation system that renders multilingual content and outlines best practices for updating and extending the data model safely.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe event data is defined in a single data module and consumed by multiple UI components. The translation system resides in a dedicated context provider that exposes a translation function used by components to render localized content.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  ED[\"eventData.ts\u003cbr/\u003eCentral event data\"] --\u003e IDX[\"Index.tsx\u003cbr/\u003ePage composition\"]\n  IDX --\u003e HS[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n  IDX --\u003e DS[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"]\n  IDX --\u003e GS[\"GoalsSection.tsx\"]\n  IDX --\u003e AS[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n  IDX --\u003e OS[\"OrganizersSection.tsx\"]\n  IDX --\u003e WS[\"WhySection.tsx\"]\n\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eTranslations\"] --\u003e HS\n  LC --\u003e DS\n  LC --\u003e GS\n  LC --\u003e AS\n  LC --\u003e OS\n  LC --\u003e WS\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Core Components\nThis section documents the event data model and its role in rendering the event page.\n\n- Event metadata\n  - title: Primary event title\n  - subtitle: Secondary title or tagline\n  - englishTitle: Alternative English title\n  - tagline: Short promotional phrase\n- Date and time\n  - date: ISO-like string representing the event date\n  - dateFormatted: Localized formatted date string\n  - dayName: Localized day of week\n  - time: Localized time range string\n- Venue\n  - name: Venue name\n  - address: Full address string\n  - details: Localized city/region details\n  - googleMapsUrl: External URL to venue on Google Maps\n  - coordinates: Latitude and longitude pair\n- Why celebrate\n  - title: Heading for the “Why” section\n  - description: Explanatory text for the celebration\n- Goals\n  - Array of goal objects with title and description\n- Agenda\n  - Array of agenda items with time, title, description, and icon\n- Organizers\n  - Array of organizer objects with name, description, optional mission, optional activities, and optional workAreas\n- Highlights\n  - Array of highlight objects with icon, title, and description\n\nHow components consume this data:\n- HeroSection renders the hero title, subtitle, tagline, and date/day/time badges using translation keys.\n- DetailsSection renders date, time, and venue information using translation keys and a static Google Maps URL.\n- GoalsSection renders the four goals using translation keys.\n- AgendaSection renders agenda items using translation keys and a predefined set of icons.\n- OrganizersSection conditionally selects organizers based on language and renders their details.\n- WhySection renders the “Why” content using translation keys.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe event data is a static, centralized object that powers multiple UI sections. Components rely on the translation system to render content in the selected language. The data model is intentionally flat and straightforward to simplify maintenance and reduce coupling.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class EventData {\n    +string title\n    +string subtitle\n    +string englishTitle\n    +string tagline\n    +string date\n    +string dateFormatted\n    +string dayName\n    +string time\n    +Venue venue\n    +WhyWhy whyCelebrate\n    +Goal[] goals\n    +AgendaItem[] agenda\n    +Organizer[] organizers\n    +Highlight[] highlights\n  }\n\n  class Venue {\n    +string name\n    +string address\n    +string details\n    +string googleMapsUrl\n    +Coordinates coordinates\n  }\n\n  class Coordinates {\n    +number lat\n    +number lng\n  }\n\n  class WhyWhy {\n    +string title\n    +string description\n  }\n\n  class Goal {\n    +string title\n    +string description\n  }\n\n  class AgendaItem {\n    +string time\n    +string title\n    +string description\n    +string icon\n  }\n\n  class Organizer {\n    +string name\n    +string description\n    +string mission\n    +string[] activities\n    +string workAreas\n  }\n\n  class Highlight {\n    +string icon\n    +string title\n    +string description\n  }\n\n  EventData --\u003e Venue\n  EventData --\u003e WhyWhy\n  EventData --\u003e Goal\n  EventData --\u003e AgendaItem\n  EventData --\u003e Organizer\n  EventData --\u003e Highlight\n  Venue --\u003e Coordinates\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Event Data Model Fields\n- title, subtitle, englishTitle, tagline\n  -

Index.tsx composes all sections\n  - Each section consumes the translation system via the LanguageContext hook\n  - DetailsSection uses a static Google Maps URL; it does not consume the venue.googleMapsUrl from the data module\n- External dependencies\n  - Translation keys are defined in LanguageContext.tsx\n  - UI components rely on Lucide icons and Tailwind classes for styling\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e HS[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e DS[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e GS[\"GoalsSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e AS[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e OS[\"OrganizersSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e WS[\"WhySection.tsx\"]\n\n  ED[\"eventData.ts\"] --\u003e HS\n  ED --\u003e DS\n  ED --\u003e GS\n  ED --\u003e AS\n  ED --\u003e OS\n  ED --\u003e WS\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L1-L54)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [WhySection.tsx](file://src/components/WhySection.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Static data model: The event data is a static object, minimizing runtime computation and network overhead.\n- Translation lookups: Components call the translation function for each rendered key; keep translation keys minimal and consistent to avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n- Venue map link: DetailsSection hardcodes the Google Maps URL; if the venue changes, update the hardcoded URL accordingly to prevent broken links.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Missing translation keys\n  - Symptom: Keys not found in the translation system return the key itself.\n  - Resolution: Ensure all keys used by components exist in the LanguageContext translations for all supported languages.\n  - References: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- Incorrect date format\n  - Symptom: Date appears inconsistent across components.\n  - Resolution: Use the dateFormatted field for display and ensure the date field remains a valid date string.\n  - References: [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- Broken venue map link\n  - Symptom: Clicking the location card opens an outdated or invalid map link.\n  - Resolution: Update the Google Maps URL in DetailsSection to match the venue’s current location.\n  - References: [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L1-L65)\n- Missing organizer fields\n  - Symptom: Some organizers lack mission or activities.\n  - Resolution: Add optional fields as needed; components handle missing optional fields gracefully.\n  -

Its straightforward shape makes it easy to maintain and extend. The translation system ensures multilingual support, and components consume the data through consistent translation keys. By following the best practices outlined here, teams can confidently update and extend the event data for future events.\n\n[No sources needed since this section summarizes without analyzing specific files]\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Validation Strategies\n- Type safety with TypeScript\n  - Define explicit TypeScript interfaces for each nested object (Venue, Coordinates, Goal, AgendaItem, Organizer, Highlight) and apply them to the event data object.\n  - Example references for structure: [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- Date validation\n  - Validate the date field against a strict date format and ensure dateFormatted aligns with the locale.\n  - Example references: [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- Venue integrity\n  - Verify that coordinates are valid numeric pairs and that the Google Maps URL is a valid URL.\n  - Example references: [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- Agenda completeness\n  - Ensure each agenda item includes time, title, description, and icon; maintain a consistent number of items if the UI expects a fixed count.\n  - Example references: [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64), [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- Organizers consistency\n  - Confirm that organizers include required fields and handle optional fields gracefully.\n  - Example references: [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132), [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n### Extending the Data Model for Future Events\n- Add new agenda items\n  - Append new agenda items to the agenda array with consistent fields.\n  - Example references: [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- Introduce new organizers\n  - Append new organizer objects to the organizers array with appropriate fields.\n  - Example references: [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- Update venue details\n  - Modify venue fields and update the Google Maps URL if the location changes.\n  - Example references: [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- Localization updates\n  - Add or update translation keys in the LanguageContext for new fields.\n  - Example references: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-31fd900b-0613-4d77-9dfe-9ab956452074","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":30917,"completion_tokens":4654,"total_tokens":35571,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
