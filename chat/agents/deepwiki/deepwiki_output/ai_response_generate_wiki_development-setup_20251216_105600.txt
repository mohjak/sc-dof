Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the development setup focused on getting contributors up and running with the sc-dof codebase.

[Architecture Overview](#architecture-overview)\n9. [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n## Introduction\nThis guide helps contributors quickly set up and run the sc-dof codebase locally. It covers prerequisites, installation, development server startup, Vite configuration, and practical tips for a smooth development experience. The project is a React application with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Node.js and npm: The project requires Node.js and npm. The repository documentation recommends installing Node.js via nvm. Ensure you have a compatible Node.js version installed using nvm before proceeding.\n- Git: To clone the repository and manage changes.\n\nKey references:\n- [README.md](file://README.md#L21-L23)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [README.md](file://README.md#L21-L23)\n\n## Installation Steps\nFollow these steps to prepare your local environment:\n\n1. Clone the repository using the project’s Git URL.\n2. Navigate to the project directory.\n3. Install dependencies using the project’s script.\n4. Start the development server with auto-reload.\n\nThese steps are documented in the repository’s README.\n\nKey references:\n- [README.md](file://README.md#L23-L37)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [README.md](file://README.md#L23-L37)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n\n## Vite Configuration Deep Dive\nThe development server and build pipeline are configured via Vite. The configuration defines the dev server host/port, React plugin, component tagging in development, and path aliases.\n\nHighlights:\n- Dev server host and port: The server binds to a host suitable for network access and runs on a specific port.\n- Plugins: React plugin is enabled. In development mode, a component tagger plugin is included.\n- Path alias: An alias is defined for the src directory to simplify imports.\n\nKey references:\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts#L1-L19)\n- [tsconfig.json](file://tsconfig.json#L1-L17)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts#L1-L19)\n- [tsconfig.json](file://tsconfig.json#L1-L17)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n## Development Workflow\n- Start the development server: Use the script defined in the project to launch Vite in development mode with hot module replacement.\n- Entry point: The HTML file mounts the React root to a div with a specific ID and loads the TypeScript entry module.\n- Application shell: The React app initializes providers for routing, internationalization, tooltips, and React Query, and renders the main routes.\n\nKey references:\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n- [index.html](file://index.html#L54-L59)\n- [src/main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [src/App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n- [index.html](file://index.html#L54-L59)\n- [src/main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [src/App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n- Port conflicts: The dev server listens on a specific port. If the port is in use, change the port in the Vite configuration or stop the conflicting process.\n- Missing dependencies: Re-run the dependency installation script to ensure all packages are present.\n- Build errors: Verify TypeScript configuration and Tailwind content paths align with your file structure.\n- ESLint warnings: Address lint rules as configured in the project’s ESLint configuration.\n\nKey references:\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts#L8-L11)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n- [eslint.config.js](file://eslint.config.js#L1-L27)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts#L8-L11)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n- [eslint.config.js](file://eslint.config.js#L1-L27)\n\n## Optimization Tips\n- Environment variables: Define environment variables for development and production as needed. Keep secrets out of version control and use environment-specific files if supported by your workflow.\n- Effective debugging: Use browser developer tools to inspect React components, network requests, and console logs. Enable React DevTools for better component inspection.\n- Fast reload: Leverage Vite’s hot module replacement to iterate quickly without full page reloads.\n- Formatting and linting: Run the linter regularly to keep code quality consistent.\n\nKey references:\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n- [eslint.config.js](file://eslint.config.js#L1-L27)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n- [eslint.config.js](file://eslint.config.js#L1-L27)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe development stack integrates Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components. The configuration establishes a predictable dev server, path aliases, and plugin chain for React and component tagging.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  Dev[\"Developer Machine\"] --\u003e NPM[\"npm scripts\u003cbr/\u003edev/build/preview\"]\n  NPM --\u003e Vite[\"Vite Dev Server\"]\n  Vite --\u003e Browser[\"Browser Runtime\"]\n  Browser --\u003e React[\"React App\u003cbr/\u003esrc/main.tsx\"]\n  React --\u003e App[\"App Shell\u003cbr/\u003esrc/App.tsx\"]\n  App --\u003e Routes[\"Routes and Pages\"]\n  Vite --\u003e Plugins[\"Plugins\u003cbr/\u003eReact + Component Tagging\"]\n  Vite --\u003e Aliases[\"Path Aliases\u003cbr/\u003e@ -\u003e src\"]\n  Vite --\u003e HostPort[\"Host and Port\u003cbr/\u003e:::8080\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts#L1-L19)\n- [src/main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [src/App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L6-L12)\n\n## Conclusion\nWith Node.js installed via nvm, dependencies installed, and the Vite dev server running, contributors can efficiently develop and iterate on the sc-dof project.
