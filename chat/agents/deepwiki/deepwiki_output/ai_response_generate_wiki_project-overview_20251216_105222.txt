Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the project overview focused on the sc-dof event platform.

The platform serves as a comprehensive event information hub, showcasing details about the agenda, speakers, goals, venue, and registration process. Built with modern web technologies, the application supports three languages—Arabic, English, and Turkish—with full RTL (right-to-left) layout support for Arabic. The platform's primary purpose is to honor the memory of Syria's liberation, celebrate the resilience of the Syrian people, and foster community engagement through a well-organized event.\n\nThe website features a clean, responsive design with smooth navigation and interactive elements. It includes sections for event details, program agenda, speaker profiles, organizational information, and a prominent registration section with QR code integration. The application leverages React's component-based architecture for maintainability and scalability, with a focus on accessibility and user experience across different devices and screen sizes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [README.md](file://README.md#L1-L74)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe project follows a standard React with TypeScript and Vite structure, organized into logical directories for components, pages, data, and utilities. The `src` directory contains the core application code, with components organized in a hierarchical structure that separates UI primitives from higher-level page components.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[src/] --\u003e B[components/]\n    A --\u003e C[pages/]\n    A --\u003e D[data/]\n    A --\u003e E[contexts/]\n    A --\u003e F[lib/]\n    A --\u003e G[hooks/]\n    A --\u003e H[App.tsx]\n    A --\u003e I[main.tsx]\n    \n    B --\u003e J[ui/] \n    B --\u003e K[AgendaSection.tsx]\n    B --\u003e L[HeroSection.tsx]\n    B --\u003e M[Navbar.tsx]\n    B --\u003e N[LanguageSwitcher.tsx]\n    \n    C --\u003e O[Index.tsx]\n    C --\u003e P[NotFound.tsx]\n    \n    D --\u003e Q[eventData.ts]\n    \n    E --\u003e R[LanguageContext.tsx]\n    \n    J --\u003e S[button.tsx]\n    J --\u003e T[card.tsx]\n    J --\u003e U[dialog.tsx]\n    J --\u003e V[form.tsx]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [src/components](file://src/components)\n- [src/pages](file://src/pages)\n- [src/data](file://src/data)\n- [src/contexts](file://src/contexts)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/components](file://src/components)\n- [src/pages](file://src/pages)\n- [src/data](file://src/data)\n- [src/contexts](file://src/contexts)\n\n## Core Components\n\nThe application's core functionality is built around several key components that handle language internationalization, navigation, and content presentation. The `LanguageContext` provides a centralized state management solution for language selection and text translation, while the `LanguageSwitcher` component enables users to toggle between Arabic, English, and Turkish. The `Navbar` component implements smooth scrolling navigation to different sections of the page, with responsive design that adapts to mobile devices.\n\nThe main content is organized into specialized components such as `HeroSection`, `AgendaSection`, `SpeakersSection`, and `RegistrationSection`, each responsible for presenting specific aspects of the event information. These components consume data from `eventData.ts` and use the translation function from the language context to display content in the selected language. The `RegistrationSection` includes a QR code component that generates a scannable code for event registration, enhancing accessibility for mobile users.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe sc-dof platform follows a modern React architecture with TypeScript, leveraging Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized production builds. The application uses a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns, where UI components are decoupled from data and state management.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[React with

class LanguageSwitcher {\n        +variant: 'floating' | 'navbar'\n        +languages: Array{code, label, flag}\n        +onClick: setLanguage\n    }\n    \n    class Navbar {\n        +t: function\n        +isRTL: boolean\n        +navLinks: Array{href, label}\n        +scrollToSection(href: string): void\n    }\n    \n    LanguageProvider --\u003e LanguageContext : \"creates context\"\n

Considerations\n\nThe platform implements several performance optimizations to ensure fast loading times and smooth user interactions. Vite provides rapid development server startup and hot module replacement, while the production build is optimized for performance with code splitting and asset optimization.\n\nThe application leverages React's virtual DOM for efficient UI updates and uses memoization patterns to prevent unnecessary re-renders. Tailwind CSS's JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler generates only the CSS classes that are actually used in the application, significantly reducing the final bundle size. The component structure follows best practices for code organization, with atomic components that can be efficiently cached and reused.\n\nImage assets are optimized and loaded only when needed, with fallbacks for missing speaker images. The QR code for registration is generated client-side, eliminating the need for external image requests. The use of CSS variables and Tailwind's utility classes enables efficient styling without the overhead of traditional CSS frameworks.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts#L1-L19)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\nCommon issues in the sc-dof platform typically relate to language persistence, responsive layout challenges, and component rendering. For language switching issues, ensure that the LanguageProvider wraps the entire application in App.tsx and that components properly consume the context using useLanguage hook.\n\nFor responsive layout problems, verify that Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:) are correctly applied to components and that the viewport meta tag is properly configured in index.html. If images are not loading, check the import paths in components and ensure that asset files exist in the correct directories.\n\nWhen components fail to render, confirm that all required props are being passed and that there are no TypeScript type errors. For routing issues, ensure that React Router's BrowserRouter is properly configured and that route paths match the navigation links. If the development server fails to start, verify that all dependencies are installed with npm install and that there are no conflicts in package.json.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts#L1-L19)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe sc-dof event platform successfully delivers a multilingual web experience for the Syrian community, combining modern web technologies with thoughtful design and internationalization. The application's architecture, built on React with TypeScript and Vite, provides a solid foundation for maintainability and scalability. The integration of Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI components enables rapid development of a consistent, accessible user interface.\n\nThe platform's internationalization system effectively supports Arabic, English, and Turkish languages with proper RTL layout handling for Arabic, demonstrating a commitment to serving the diverse needs of the Syrian diaspora. The event information is presented in a clear, organized manner with intuitive navigation and engaging visual elements.\n\nFuture enhancements could include server-side rendering for improved SEO, additional language support, and enhanced accessibility features. The current implementation provides a robust foundation that can be extended to support additional events and community initiatives.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-05604c5f-9f66-4780-9a1b-7113a9c8b22f","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":29184,"completion_tokens":3427,"total_tokens":32611,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
