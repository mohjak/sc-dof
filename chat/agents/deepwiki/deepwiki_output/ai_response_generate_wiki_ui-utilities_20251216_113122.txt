Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate architectural documentation for utility components and functions. Focus on 'cn' from lib/utils.ts for conditional className composition using clsx. Explain its role in theme integration and RTL class switching. Document useToast hook for programmatic toast notifications, including its integration with Sonner and Toaster components. Provide usage patterns from across the codebase, such as showing success messages after language change. Detail type safety with TypeScript interfaces. Address tree-shaking benefits via components.json configuration. Include performance considerations like memoizing cn results and avoiding unnecessary toast stacking. Troubleshoot common issues like class ordering conflicts and toast persistence bugs.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nUtility Components \u0026 Hooks\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

[Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n## Introduction\nThis document provides comprehensive architectural documentation for utility components and hooks in the sc-dof application, focusing on the `cn` function for conditional className composition and the `useToast` hook for programmatic toast notifications. These utilities are foundational to the application's UI consistency, accessibility, and user experience. The `cn` function enables robust class composition using Tailwind Merge and clsx, while the toast system provides a centralized mechanism for user feedback. Both systems are deeply integrated with the application's theming, internationalization, and RTL support infrastructure.\n\n## Core Utility Functions\n\nThe utility system in sc-dof consists of two primary components: the `cn` function for className composition and the `useToast` hook for notification management. These utilities are designed to be lightweight, type-safe, and easily composable across the application.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n\n## Conditional Class Composition with cn\n\n### Function Implementation\nThe `cn` function is a utility wrapper that combines `clsx` for conditional class evaluation and `tailwind-merge` for conflict resolution in Tailwind CSS classes. This combination ensures that when multiple conflicting Tailwind classes are applied, the last one takes precedence while maintaining proper class ordering.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    Start[\"cn(...inputs)\"] --\u003e Clsx[\"clsx(inputs)\"]\n    Clsx --\u003e TwMerge[\"twMerge(classNames)\"]\n    TwMerge --\u003e Result[\"Merged className string\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L4-L6)\n\n### Theme Integration\nThe `cn` function plays a critical role in theme integration by resolving class conflicts that occur when applying theme-specific classes. When components receive className props from both the parent and internal implementation, `cn` ensures that user-provided classes take precedence over default styles while properly merging non-conflicting classes.\n\n### RTL Class Switching\nFor RTL (Right-to-Left) support, particularly with Arabic language selection, the `cn` function enables dynamic layout adjustments. When the `isRTL` flag from `LanguageContext` is true, components can conditionally apply RTL-specific classes that are properly merged with existing styles without conflicts.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L13-L20)\n\n## Toast Notification System\n\n### Architecture Overview\nThe toast notification system is built on a reducer-based state management pattern that operates as a singleton across the application. It uses an in-memory state store with global listeners to enable toast functionality without requiring React context for state propagation.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class useToast {\n        +state: State\n        +toast: ToastFunction\n        +dismiss: DismissFunction\n        -setState: ReactStateSetter\n    }\n    \n    class toast {\n        +id: string\n        +dismiss: Function\n        +update: Function\n    }\n    \n    class State {\n        +toasts: ToasterToast[]\n    }\n    \n    class ToasterToast {\n        +id: string\n        +title: ReactNode\n        +description: ReactNode\n        +action: ToastActionElement\n        +open: boolean\n    }\n    \n    useToast --\u003e State : \"manages\"\n    useToast --\u003e toast : \"exposes\"\n    toast --\u003e ToasterToast : \"creates\"\n    useToast --\u003e Toaster : \"consumed by\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L166-L186)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L24)\n\n### Core Components\nThe toast system consists of several key components:\n- `useToast`: Custom hook that provides access to toast state and creation functions\n- `toast`: Imperative function for creating toast notifications\n- `Toaster`: UI component that renders active toasts\n- `Sonner`: External toast library integration for enhanced styling\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n- [toaster.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toaster.tsx#L1-L24)\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n\n## Integration with Theme and RTL\n\n### Theme Integration\nThe toast system integrates with the application's theme through the `Sonner` component, which consumes the `useTheme` hook from `next-themes`. This allows toast notifications to automatically adapt to the current theme (light, dark, or system) with appropriate styling for background, text, and border colors.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    ThemeProvider --\u003e useTheme\n    useTheme --\u003e Sonner\n    Sonner --\u003e ToastStyles\n    ToastStyles --\u003e \"group-[.toaster]:bg-background\"\n    ToastStyles --\u003e \"group-[.toaster]:text-foreground\"\n    ToastStyles --\u003e \"group-[.toaster]:border-border\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [sonner.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sonner.tsx#L1-L28)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n### RTL Support\nThe toast system respects RTL layout when Arabic is selected as the interface language. The `Toaster` component's positioning is adjusted through Tailwind's directional utilities, ensuring that toast notifications appear in the correct location (top-left for RTL, bottom-right for LTR).\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L13-L20)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276-L277)\n\n## Usage Patterns Across Codebase\n\n### Language Change Success Messages\nWhen users change the interface language via the `LanguageSwitcher` component, the application can programmatically show toast notifications to confirm the change. This pattern demonstrates the integration between the internationalization system and the toast notification system.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant LanguageSwitcher\n    participant LanguageContext\n    participant useToast\n    participant ToastUI\n    \n    User-\u003e\u003eLanguageSwitcher: Click language button\n    LanguageSwitcher-\u003e\u003eLanguageContext: setLanguage(newLang)\n    LanguageContext-\u003e\u003eApp: Re-render with new language\n    App-\u003e\u003euseToast: toast({title, description})\n    useToast-\u003e\u003euseToast: dispatch(ADD_TOAST)\n    useToast-\u003e\u003eToastUI: State update\n    ToastUI-\u003e\u003eUser: Display toast notification\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L283)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L137-L164)\n\n### Common Usage Patterns\nThe `cn` function is widely used throughout UI components for conditional class application. Common patterns include:\n- Combining base styles with variant styles\n- Applying responsive classes\n- Adding state-based classes (hover, focus, active)\n- Merging user-provided className props with component defaults\n\n**Section sources**\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L6)\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx#L12)\n\n## Type Safety and TypeScript Interfaces\n\n### cn Function Typing\nThe `cn` function is fully type-safe with TypeScript, using the `ClassValue` type from `clsx` to accept a wide range of input types including strings, objects, and arrays. This ensures type safety while maintaining flexibility in class composition.\n\n```typescript\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]): string\n```\n\n### Toast System Interfaces\nThe toast system defines several TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety:\n- `ToastProps`: Defines the props for the Toast component\n- `ToastActionElement`: Type for toast action elements\n- `ToasterToast`: Extended toast interface with id and state\n- `Action`: Union type for toast actions (ADD, UPDATE, DISMISS, REMOVE)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L4-L6)\n- [toast.tsx](file://src/components/ui/toast.tsx#L97-L100)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L8-L13)\n\n## Tree-Shaking and Module Optimization\n\n### components.json Configuration\nThe `components.json` file enables tree-shaking benefits by defining aliases and configuration for the component library. This allows bundlers to eliminate unused code and optimize the final bundle size.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"aliases\": {\n    \"components\": \"@/components\",\n    \"utils\": \"@/lib/utils\",\n    \"ui\": \"@/components/ui\",\n    \"lib\": \"@/lib\",\n    \"hooks\": \"@/hooks\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe alias configuration ensures that imports are resolved consistently and enables better dead code elimination during the build process.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n- [tsconfig.json](file://tsconfig.json)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n### Memoizing cn Results\nWhile the `cn` function is lightweight, in performance-critical components it's recommended to memoize the results when the input classes are derived from props or state. This prevents unnecessary re-computation on every render.\n\n### Avoiding Toast Stacking\nThe toast system implements several performance safeguards:\n- `TOAST_LIMIT = 1`: Limits the number of simultaneous toasts to prevent stacking\n- `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY = 1000000`: Long delay before automatic removal to prevent premature cleanup\n- Map-based timeout tracking to prevent memory leaks from uncleaned timeouts\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    ToastCreation --\u003e CheckLimit[\"Check TOAST_LIMIT\"]\n    CheckLimit --\u003e|Below limit| AddToast[\"Add to queue\"]\n    CheckLimit --\u003e|At limit| ReplaceToast[\"Replace existing\"]\n    AddToast --\u003e ScheduleRemoval[\"addToRemoveQueue()\"]\n    ScheduleRemoval --\u003e TrackTimeout[\"toastTimeouts.set()\"]\n    TrackTimeout --\u003e Wait[\"Wait TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY\"]\n    Wait --\u003e RemoveToast[\"dispatch(REMOVE_TOAST)\"]\n    RemoveToast --\u003e Cleanup[\"toastTimeouts.delete()\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L5-L7)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L53-L69)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\n### Class Ordering Conflicts\nWhen using the `cn` function, developers may encounter class ordering conflicts where expected styles are overridden. This occurs because Tailwind classes are applied in order, and later classes take precedence. To resolve this:\n\n1. Ensure the desired classes are ordered correctly in the `cn` function call\n2. Use `!important` sparingly with Tailwind's `!` prefix when necessary\n3. Leverage `tailwind-merge`'s conflict resolution rules\n\n### Toast Persistence Bugs\nCommon toast persistence issues include:\n- Toasts not disappearing automatically\n- Memory leaks from uncleaned timeouts\n- Duplicate toasts appearing\n\nThese issues are addressed through:\n- Proper cleanup in `useEffect` return functions\n- Using a Map to track and prevent duplicate timeouts\n- Ensuring the `listeners` array is properly managed\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L53-L69)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L166-L186)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe utility components and hooks in sc-dof provide a robust foundation for className composition and user notifications. The `cn` function enables reliable class merging with proper conflict resolution, while the toast system offers a flexible, type-safe mechanism for user feedback. Both systems are deeply integrated with the application's theming, internationalization, and RTL support, ensuring a consistent user experience across all languages and themes. By following the documented patterns and best practices, developers can effectively leverage these utilities while avoiding common pitfalls related to performance and usability.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-dbcf6a67-bb99-4289-bf14-7a844bb5c32e","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":31781,"completion_tokens":2955,"total_tokens":34736,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
