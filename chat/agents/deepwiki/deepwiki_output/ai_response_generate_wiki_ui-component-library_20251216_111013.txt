Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive documentation for the ShadCN UI component library integration, which is built on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. Explain how the project leverages pre-built accessible components like Button, Card, Dialog, DropdownMenu, and Form to ensure consistency and reduce development time. Detail the utility function 'cn' from utils.ts that combines Tailwind classes with conditional logic. Describe how components are extended through composition rather than inheritance, using props to customize appearance and behavior. Illustrate usage patterns with concrete examples, such as how Navbar uses Button and DropdownMenu for language switching, or how Forms are constructed with Label, Input, and Checkbox components. Address common issues like component styling conflicts, version mismatches, and accessibility compliance. Provide guidance on adding new UI components using the ShadCN CLI and maintaining design system consistency.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nUI Component Library Integration\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

The UI system is built on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, following modern component architecture principles. The implementation leverages pre-built, accessible components to ensure design consistency, reduce development time, and maintain high accessibility standards. This documentation covers the core utility functions, component composition patterns, usage examples, and integration guidelines for maintaining a cohesive design system.\n\n## Project Structure\n\nThe project follows a modular structure with clear separation of concerns. UI components are organized in a dedicated directory with atomic design principles, while utility functions and configuration files support the overall styling and behavior system.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n    subgraph \"Source\"\n        src[src/]\n        \n        subgraph \"Components\"\n            components[components/]\n            ui[ui/] --\u003e components\n            custom[Custom Components] --\u003e components\n        end\n        \n        subgraph \"Libraries \u0026 Utilities\"\n            lib[lib/] --\u003e src\n            hooks[hooks/] --\u003e src\n        end\n        \n        subgraph \"Configuration\"\n            config[tailwind.config.ts] --\u003e src\n            indexcss[index.css] --\u003e src\n        end\n    end\n    \n    ui --\u003e|Uses| lib\n    ui --\u003e|Uses| config\n    ui --\u003e|Uses| indexcss\n    custom --\u003e|Uses| ui\n    custom --\u003e|Uses| lib\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [src/components/ui](file://src/components/ui)\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [project_structure](file://project_structure)\n- [src/components](file://src/components)\n\n## Core Components\n\nThe ShadCN UI component library provides a collection of pre-built, accessible components that serve as the foundation for the application's user interface. These components are built on Radix UI primitives, ensuring proper accessibility semantics, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. The core components include Button, Card, Dialog, DropdownMenu, Form, Input, Label, Checkbox, and others, all styled consistently with Tailwind CSS. These components are designed to be composable and extensible through props rather than inheritance, enabling flexible customization while maintaining design system consistency.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx)\n- [src/components/ui/card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx)\n- [src/components/ui/dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx)\n- [src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx)\n- [src/components/ui/form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx)\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe UI architecture follows a layered approach with ShadCN components at the foundation, built on Radix UI accessibility primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. The system uses a utility-first CSS approach with component-specific styling and global theme configuration. The architecture enables consistent design patterns across the application while allowing for targeted customization through props and conditional logic.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Application Components] --\u003e B[ShadCN UI Components]\n    B --\u003e C[Radix UI Primitives]\n    C --\u003e D[React]\n    B --\u003e E[Tailwind CSS]\n    E --\u003e F[Tailwind Configuration]\n    F --\u003e G[tailwind.config.ts]\n    F --\u003e H[index.css]\n    B --\u003e I[Utility Functions]\n    I --\u003e J[cn function]\n    J --\u003e K[clsx]\n    J --\u003e L[tailwind-merge]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [src/components/ui/*.tsx](file://src/components/ui)\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Component Composition and Utility Functions\n\nThe component library relies heavily on composition rather than inheritance, allowing developers to customize appearance and behavior through props. This approach promotes reusability and maintainability across the codebase.\n\n#### Utility Function: cn\nThe `cn` function from `utils.ts` is a critical utility that combines Tailwind classes with conditional logic, enabling dynamic class composition. It uses `clsx` for conditional class evaluation and `tailwind-merge` to safely merge Tailwind classes without conflicts.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class cn {\n        +...inputs: ClassValue[]\n        +return: string\n    }\n    \n    class clsx {\n        +...inputs: ClassValue[]\n        +return: string\n    }\n    \n    class tailwindMerge {\n        +...classNames: string[]\n        +return: string\n    }\n    \n    cn --\u003e clsx : \"uses\"\n    cn --\u003e tailwindMerge : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n### UI Component Implementation Patterns\n\n#### Button Component Analysis\nThe Button component demonstrates the use of `cva` (Class Variant Authority) for defining variant and size styles, allowing for consistent styling across different button types. It supports composition through the `asChild` prop, enabling it to render as different HTML elements while maintaining styling.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Button {\n        +className: string\n        +variant: 'default' | 'destructive' | 'outline' | 'secondary' | 'ghost' | 'link'\n        +size: 'default' | 'sm' | 'lg' | 'icon'\n        +asChild: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class buttonVariants {\n        +variants: { variant, size }\n        +defaultVariants: { variant: 'default', size: 'default' }\n    }\n    \n    Button --\u003e buttonVariants : \"uses\"\n    Button --\u003e cn : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/components/ui/button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n\n#### Form Component Architecture\nThe Form component system uses React Hook Form for state management and validation, providing a robust foundation for form handling. It implements a context-based architecture with FormField, FormItem, FormLabel, FormControl, FormDescription, and FormMessage components that work together to create accessible forms.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Form] --\u003e B[FormProvider]\n    A --\u003e C[useFormContext]\n    D[FormField] --\u003e E[Controller]\n    D --\u003e F[FormFieldContext]\n    G[FormItem] --\u003e H[FormItemContext]\n    I[FormLabel] --\u003e J[useFormField]\n    K[FormControl] --\u003e J\n    L[FormDescription] --\u003e J\n    M[FormMessage] --\u003e J\n    J --\u003e C\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [src/components/ui/form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L130)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/components/ui/form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L130)\n\n### Real-World Usage Examples\n\n#### Navbar and Language Switcher Integration\nThe Navbar component demonstrates practical usage of ShadCN components in a real-world scenario, combining Button patterns with DropdownMenu for language switching functionality.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Navbar] --\u003e B[LanguageSwitcher]\n    B --\u003e C[DropdownMenu]\n    C --\u003e D[DropdownMenuTrigger]\n    C --\u003e E[DropdownMenuContent]\n    E --\u003e F[DropdownMenuItem]\n    A --\u003e G[Navigation Links]\n    G --\u003e H[Button-like styling]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [src/components/Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [src/components/Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n\nThe component library has well-defined dependencies that support its functionality and styling. These dependencies are managed through npm and configured in the project's package.json and components.json files.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[ShadCN Components] --\u003e B[Radix UI]\n    A --\u003e C[Tailwind CSS]\n    A --\u003e D[Class Variance Authority]\n    A --\u003e E[clsx]\n    A --\u003e F[tailwind-merge]\n    B --\u003e G[React]\n    C --\u003e H[PostCSS]\n    D --\u003e I[TypeScript]\n    E --\u003e J[JavaScript Utilities]\n    F --\u003e K[Tailwind CSS]\n    \n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333\n    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n    style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThe component library implementation follows performance best practices including tree-shaking through selective imports, efficient class merging with tailwind-merge, and minimal re-renders through proper React component patterns. The use of Radix UI primitives ensures optimal accessibility performance with minimal overhead. The configuration in components.json enables proper bundling and optimization of UI components.\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\nCommon issues in the ShadCN UI integration include styling conflicts, version mismatches, and accessibility compliance problems. To address styling conflicts, ensure proper use of the `cn` utility function and avoid direct Tailwind class conflicts. For version mismatches, maintain consistent versions of Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, and related dependencies as specified in package.json. Accessibility issues can be mitigated by following the built-in accessibility patterns of Radix UI components and testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation. When adding new components, use the ShadCN CLI to ensure proper integration with the existing design system.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe ShadCN UI component library integration provides a robust foundation for the application's user interface, leveraging Radix UI primitives for accessibility and Tailwind CSS for styling. The architecture promotes consistency, reduces development time, and ensures high accessibility standards. By following the composition-based approach and utilizing the provided utility functions, developers can create cohesive user interfaces while maintaining flexibility for customization. The documented patterns and examples serve as a guide for maintaining design system consistency and addressing common implementation challenges.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-4993b0b1-c669-4ed9-bfea-59aecf9c7657","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":29921,"completion_tokens":2761,"total_tokens":32682,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
