Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the data management system focused on how event information and translations are structured and accessed.

The system is built around two core components: the `eventData.ts` file, which serves as the central data model containing all event information, and the `LanguageContext.tsx` file, which enables multilingual support across the application. The data architecture follows a static-first approach with potential for future dynamic data loading, using React's Context API for global state management and component-level data consumption patterns.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n\n## Core Data Model: eventData.ts\nThe `eventData.ts` file contains a comprehensive data model that defines all aspects of the Liberation Day event. This central configuration object includes event metadata such as title, date, and venue, as well as structured content for various sections of the application including goals, agenda items, organizers, and highlights.\n\nThe data structure is organized into logical sections:\n- **Event Metadata**: Title, subtitle, date, time, and formatted date strings\n- **Venue Information**: Complete venue details including name, address, Google Maps URL, and geographic coordinates\n- **Content Sections**: Structured data for why celebration, goals, agenda, and organizers\n- **Visual Highlights**: Icon-based highlights that summarize key event aspects\n\nThis centralized approach allows for easy maintenance and updates to event information without requiring changes to component logic. All components consume this data directly or through derived state, ensuring consistency across the application.\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n  EVENT_DATA {\n    string title\n    string subtitle\n    string englishTitle\n    string tagline\n    string date\n    string dateFormatted\n    string dayName\n    string time\n  }\n\n  VENUE {\n    string name\n    string address\n    string details\n    string googleMapsUrl\n    float lat\n    float lng\n  }\n\n  GOAL {\n    string title\n    string description\n  }\n\n  AGENDA_ITEM {\n    string time\n    string title\n    string description\n    string icon\n  }\n\n  ORGANIZER {\n    string name\n    string description\n    string mission\n    array activities\n  }\n\n  HIGHLIGHT {\n    string icon\n    string title\n    string description\n  }\n\n  EVENT_DATA ||--o{ VENUE : contains\n  EVENT_DATA ||--o{ GOAL : contains\n  EVENT_DATA ||--o{ AGENDA_ITEM : contains\n  EVENT_DATA ||--o{ ORGANIZER : contains\n  EVENT_DATA ||--o{ HIGHLIGHT : contains\n```\n\n**Diagram sources **\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Translation System with LanguageContext\nThe multilingual capabilities of the application are managed through the `LanguageContext.tsx` file, which implements React's Context API to provide translation services across all components. The system supports three languages: Arabic (ar), English (en), and Turkish (tr), with Arabic as the default language.\n\nThe translation system is built around a nested object structure where translations are organized by language and then by functional area (e.g., navigation, hero section, details). Each translation key follows a dot-notation pattern (e.g., 'nav.home', 'hero.title') that reflects its location and purpose in the application.\n\nKey features of the translation system include:\n- **Directionality Support**: Automatic RTL (right-to-left) layout for Arabic content\n- **Translation Function**: A `t()` function that safely returns translation values or fallback keys\n- **Language Switching**: State management for dynamic language changes\n- **Component Integration**: Seamless integration with UI components through the `useLanguage` hook\n\nThe context provider wraps the entire application in `App.tsx`, ensuring that all components have access to the current language setting and translation functions.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class LanguageContextType {\n        +language: Language\n        +setLanguage(lang: Language): void\n        +t(key: string): string\n        +isRTL: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class LanguageProvider {\n        -language: Language\n        -setLanguage: Dispatch\u003cSetStateAction\u003cLanguage\u003e\u003e\n        +t(key: string): string\n        +isRTL: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class useLanguage {\n        +returns: LanguageContextType\n    }\n    \n    class TranslationStructure {\n        +ar: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e\n        +en: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e\n        +tr: Record\u003cstring, string\u003e\n    }\n    \n    LanguageProvider --\u003e LanguageContextType : implements\n    useLanguage --\u003e LanguageContext : consumes\n    LanguageProvider --\u003e TranslationStructure : uses\n```\n\n**Diagram sources **\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L5-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L6-L31)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L5-L292)\n\n## Data Flow and Component Integration\nThe application follows a clear data flow pattern where the central `eventData` and `LanguageContext` are consumed by various UI components to render content. The `Index.tsx` page serves as the main composition point, importing and arranging all section components in the desired order.\n\nComponents access data through two primary mechanisms:\n1. **Direct Import**: Components like `AgendaSection` and `DetailsSection` import `eventData` directly to access event-specific information\n2. **Context Consumption**: All components use `LanguageContext` to access translations and current language settings\n\nThe integration pattern ensures that content remains consistent while allowing for language-specific adaptations. For example, the `DetailsSection` component uses translation keys to display labels while pulling date and venue information from `eventData`.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"App.tsx\\n(QueryClientProvider,\\nTooltipProvider,\\nLanguageProvider)\"] --\u003e B[\"Index.tsx\\n(Main Page Composition)\"]\n    \n    B --\u003e C[\"HeroSection\"]\n    B --\u003e D[\"WhySection\"]\n    B --\u003e E[\"GoalsSection\"]\n    B --\u003e F[\"DetailsSection\"]\n    B --\u003e G[\"AgendaSection\"]\n    B --\u003e H[\"SpeakersSection\"]\n    B --\u003e I[\"OrganizersSection\"]\n    B --\u003e J[\"RegistrationSection\"]\n    \n    K[\"eventData.ts\\n(Central Data Model)\"] --\u003e F\n    K --\u003e G\n    K --\u003e H\n    K --\u003e I\n    K --\u003e J\n    \n    L[\"LanguageContext.tsx\\n(Translation System)\"] --\u003e C\n    L --\u003e D\n    L --\u003e E\n    L --\u003e F\n    L --\u003e G\n    L --\u003e H\n    L --\u003e I\n    L --\u003e J\n    \n    M[\"useLanguage Hook\"] --\u003e C\n    M --\u003e D\n    M --\u003e E\n    M --\u003e F\n    M --\u003e G\n    M --\u003e H\n    M --\u003e I\n    M --\u003e J\n    \n    style K fill:#f9f,stroke:#333\n    style L fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n**Diagram sources **\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L5-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L5-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Speakers Data Management\nThe speakers data is managed within the `SpeakersSection.tsx` component, which defines a comprehensive data structure for speaker information. Unlike other event data that comes from `eventData.ts`, the speakers data is co-located with its consuming component, following a colocation pattern that keeps related code together.\n\nThe speaker data model includes:\n- **Multilingual Fields**: Name and role in Arabic, English, and Turkish\n- **Identification**: Unique ID and image reference\n- **Professional Information**: Role/position with language-specific variations\n\nThe component implements a language-aware rendering system that selects the appropriate name and role based on the current language setting from `LanguageContext`. This ensures that speaker information is presented in the user's preferred language while maintaining data consistency.\n\nThe data flow for speakers follows a self-contained pattern:\n1. The component defines the speakers array with multilingual data\n2. It consumes the current language setting via `useLanguage`\n3. It uses helper functions (`getName`, `getRole`) to select language-appropriate values\n4. It renders the speaker cards with proper images and formatting\n\nThis approach provides flexibility for speaker management while maintaining integration with the global translation system for section titles and UI elements.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Speaker {\n        +id: number\n        +name: string\n        +nameEn: string\n        +nameTr: string\n        +role: string\n        +roleEn: string\n        +roleTr: string\n        +image?: string\n    }\n    \n    class SpeakersSection {\n        +speakers: Speaker[]\n        +getName(speaker: Speaker): string\n        +getRole(speaker: Speaker): string\n    }\n    \n    class LanguageContext {\n        +language: Language\n        +t(key: string): string\n    }\n    \n    SpeakersSection --\u003e Speaker : contains\n    SpeakersSection --\u003e LanguageContext : consumes\n```\n\n**Diagram sources **\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n\n## Common Data Management Issues\nThe current data management system presents several considerations and potential issues that should be addressed:\n\n**Stale Data Risk**: Since all event data is statically defined in `eventData.ts`, there is a risk of information becoming outdated if not properly maintained. The lack of data validation or type checking increases the potential for errors in date formats, URL structures, or missing fields.\n\n**Data Duplication**: Some information appears in multiple locations (e.g., venue details in both `eventData` and translations), creating maintenance challenges and potential inconsistencies when updates are needed.\n\n**Limited Extensibility**: The static data model makes it difficult to add new event instances or support multiple events without significant code changes.\n\n**Image Management**: Speaker images are imported directly in the component, which can lead to bundle size issues as the number of speakers grows.\n\n**Translation Maintenance**: The translation system requires manual updates for new content, and there is no mechanism to identify missing translations or verify translation completeness.\n\nStrategies to mitigate these issues include implementing data validation, creating a build-time check for translation completeness, and establishing clear ownership and update processes for the data files.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx)\n\n## Future Extensibility and External Data Loading\nWhile the current implementation uses static data files, the architecture supports future extensibility through external data sources. The foundation is already in place with React Query being initialized in `App.tsx`, providing a mechanism for data fetching, caching, and synchronization.\n\nPotential approaches for external data loading include:\n\n**API Integration**: Create endpoints to serve event data in JSON format, allowing for dynamic content updates without redeployment. This could support multiple events or seasonal content changes.\n\n**Content Management System**: Integrate with a headless CMS to allow non-technical users to update event information, speakers, and agenda items through a visual interface.\n\n**Hybrid Approach**: Maintain critical data (like venue and date) in static files for reliability while loading dynamic content (like speaker updates or agenda changes) from an API.\n\n**Internationalization Enhancement**: Implement a translation management system that allows for community contributions to translations, with versioning and review workflows.\n\nThe transition to external data sources would require minimal changes to the current architecture:\n1. Replace direct imports of `eventData` with `useQuery` hooks\n2. Update the `LanguageContext` to load translations from an API\n3. Implement loading and error states for data fetching\n4. Add caching strategies to minimize network requests\n\nThis evolutionary path maintains the current user experience while enabling more dynamic content management.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    A[\"Current Architecture\"] --\u003e B[\"Static Data Files\"]\n    A --\u003e C[\"Direct Imports\"]\n    A --\u003e D[\"Compile-time Bundling\"]\n    \n    E[\"Future Architecture\"] --\u003e F[\"External API\"]\n    E --\u003e G[\"React Query Hooks\"]\n    E --\u003e H[\"Runtime Data Fetching\"]\n    E --\u003e I[\"Dynamic Updates\"]\n    \n    J[\"App.tsx\\n(QueryClient)\"] --\u003e G\n    G --\u003e K[\"useQuery\\n(eventData)\"]\n    G --\u003e L[\"useQuery\\n(translations)\"]\n    F --\u003e M[\"CMS or\\nBackend Service\"]\n    \n    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333\n    style E fill:#bbf,stroke:#333\n```\n\n**Diagram sources **\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L4-L10)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L4-L10)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe data management system for the Syrian Community event platform effectively combines a centralized data model with a robust translation system to deliver multilingual event information. The `eventData.ts` file serves as a single source of truth for event details, while the `LanguageContext.tsx` enables seamless language switching and RTL support. Components consume this data through direct imports and context consumption, creating a maintainable architecture that balances simplicity with functionality.\n\nThe system demonstrates good practices in data organization and internationalization, with opportunities for future enhancement through external data sources and improved data validation. By leveraging React Query (already initialized in the application), the platform is well-positioned to evolve from static data to dynamic content delivery while maintaining its core user experience.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-2b211b03-e43d-41d0-9b22-9d5d79466eac","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":31804,"completion_tokens":3296,"total_tokens":35100,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
