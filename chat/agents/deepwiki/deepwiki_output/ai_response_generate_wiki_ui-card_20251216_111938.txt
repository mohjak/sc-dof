Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the Card component used in SpeakersSection, AgendaSection, and OrganizersSection.

It explains the composition pattern with CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, and CardContent, how it integrates with Tailwind utility classes for consistent spacing and shadows, and how event data is rendered inside cards. It also covers responsive behavior, accessibility, customization via className overrides and theme extensions, and troubleshooting layout overflow issues.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe Card component is a reusable UI primitive located under the UI components folder. Sections that use cards include SpeakersSection, AgendaSection, and OrganizersSection. The theming system is configured via Tailwind CSS and CSS variables, enabling consistent color tokens and shadows across the app.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"UI Primitives\"\n    CardComp[\"Card primitives\u003cbr/\u003ecard.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Sections\"\n    Speakers[\"SpeakersSection.tsx\"]\n    Agenda[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n    Organizers[\"OrganizersSection.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Data\"\n    EventData[\"eventData.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Styling\"\n    TailwindCfg[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n    CSSVars[\"index.css\"]\n    Utils[\"utils.ts\"]\n    ComponentsJson[\"components.json\"]\n  end\n\n  Speakers --\u003e CardComp\n  Agenda --\u003e CardComp\n  Organizers --\u003e CardComp\n  EventData --\u003e Agenda\n  EventData --\u003e Organizers\n  CardComp --\u003e TailwindCfg\n  CardComp --\u003e CSSVars\n  CardComp --\u003e Utils\n  ComponentsJson --\u003e TailwindCfg\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n## Core Components\nThe Card component family consists of:\n- Card: Base container with rounded corners, border, background, and shadow.\n- CardHeader: Column stack with tight vertical spacing and padding.\n- CardTitle: Heading element with size and weight appropriate for card titles.\n- CardDescription: Paragraph with muted text and small size.\n- CardContent: Main content area with reduced top padding to align with header spacing.\n- CardFooter: Footer area with consistent padding and alignment.\n\nThese primitives are composed to build structured, accessible cards with consistent spacing and typography.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe Card primitives are used by three sections:\n- SpeakersSection renders speaker profiles in a responsive grid.\n- AgendaSection renders timed agenda segments with icons and subtle hover effects.\n- OrganizersSection renders organizational information with logos and activity tags.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant UI as \"UI Layer\"\n  participant Card as \"Card primitives\"\n  participant Section as \"Section Components\"\n  participant Data as \"eventData.ts\"\n  participant Theme as \"Tailwind/CSS\"\n\n  UI-\u003e\u003eSection: Render section with data\n  Section-\u003e\u003eCard: Compose CardHeader/CardTitle/CardDescription/CardContent\n  Section-\u003e\u003eTheme: Apply Tailwind utilities (spacing, shadows, colors)\n  Section-\u003e\u003eData: Read localized/agenda/organizer data\n  Section--\u003e\u003eUI: Rendered cards with consistent styles\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Card Composition Pattern\nThe Card primitives are forwardRef-based components that accept className and pass-through props. They rely on Tailwind utility classes for consistent spacing, typography, and color tokens.\n\nKey characteristics:\n- Card sets base background, border, and shadow tokens.\n- CardHeader stacks children vertically with tight spacing and padding.\n- CardTitle applies heading sizing and weight.\n- CardDescription uses muted text and small size.\n- CardContent removes top padding to align with header spacing.\n- CardFooter provides consistent footer layout.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class Card {\n    +HTMLDivElement\n    +className\n    +HTMLAttributes\n  }\n  class CardHeader {\n    +HTMLDivElement\n    +className\n    +HTMLAttributes\n  }\n  class CardTitle {\n    +HTMLParagraphElement\n    +className\n    +HTMLAttributes\n  }\n  class CardDescription {\n    +HTMLParagraphElement\n    +className\n    +HTMLAttributes\n  }\n  class CardContent {\n    +HTMLDivElement\n    +className\n    +HTMLAttributes\n  }\n  class CardFooter {\n    +HTMLDivElement\n    +className\n    +HTMLAttributes\n  }\n\n  Card --\u003e CardHeader : \"contains\"\n  Card --\u003e CardTitle : \"contains\"\n  Card --\u003e CardDescription : \"contains\"\n  Card --\u003e CardContent : \"contains\"\n  Card --\u003e CardFooter : \"contains\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n### Integration with Tailwind Utilities\nThe Card primitives integrate with Tailwind via:\n- Color tokens: card, card-foreground, border, background, muted, foreground.\n- Spacing: padding and space utilities for header/content/footer.\n- Shadows: default shadow-sm on Card.\n- Utility merging: cn combines incoming className with defaults.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Card render\"]) --\u003e Merge[\"Merge default classes with className\"]\n  Merge --\u003e ApplyColors[\"Apply color tokens:\u003cbr/\u003ebg-card, text-card-foreground, border\"]\n  ApplyColors --\u003e ApplySpacing[\"Apply spacing:\u003cbr/\u003eheader padding, content padding\"]\n  ApplySpacing --\u003e ApplyShadows[\"Apply shadow-sm\"]\n  ApplyShadows --\u003e End([\"Render\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n\n### Real Code Examples: Rendering Event Data in Cards\n- AgendaSection demonstrates rendering timed agenda segments with icons and localized titles/descriptions. It composes a card-like structure using Tailwind utilities and local data.\n- OrganizersSection renders organizational information with logos and activity tags, using card-like containers with consistent spacing and hover effects.\n- SpeakersSection uses a card-like layout with profile images and localized names/roles.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Section as \"AgendaSection\"\n  participant Data as \"eventData.ts\"\n  participant Theme as \"Tailwind/CSS\"\n\n  Section-\u003e\u003eData: Access agenda items\n  Section-\u003e\u003eTheme: Apply bg-card, rounded-2xl, p-6, shadow-lg\n  Section--\u003e\u003eSection: Render time, icon, title, description\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n- Semantic structure: Use CardTitle for headings within cards to preserve heading hierarchy.\n- Contrast: Ensure text colors meet contrast ratios against card backgrounds using theme tokens.\n- Focus and interactions: Hover states should remain keyboard accessible; avoid relying solely on hover for critical information.\n- Images: Provide alt text for profile and logo images; fallback visuals are present when images are missing.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nThe Card primitives depend on:\n- Tailwind configuration for color tokens and radius.\n- CSS variables for theme-aware colors and shadows.\n- Utility function cn for safe class merging.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Card[\"card.tsx\"] --\u003e Tailwind[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  Card --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  Card --\u003e CN[\"utils.ts\"]\n  ComponentsJson[\"components.json\"] --\u003e Tailwind\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Prefer className overrides over heavy inline styles to keep DOM lightweight.\n- Use minimal re-renders by passing stable data references to sections.\n- Avoid excessive nesting within cards to reduce layout thrashing.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Accessibility Guidelines\n- Maintain heading order: place CardTitle as an h3 within CardHeader or as a sibling to CardHeader.\n- Ensure sufficient contrast: verify text-foreground vs bg-card contrast across light/dark themes.\n- Provide meaningful alt attributes for images inside cards.\n- Test keyboard navigation and focus visibility.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Customization and Theming\n- className overrides: Pass additional classes to Card to adjust padding, margins, or colors without altering the primitive.\n- Theme extensions: Extend Tailwind colors and radius in tailwind.config.ts to customize card appearance globally.\n- CSS variables: Adjust color tokens and shadows in index.css to change card colors and elevation.\n\nPractical customization examples:\n- Override background and border: apply bg-card and border-border via className.\n- Change corner radius: use rounded variants via className.\n- Modify shadows: apply shadow-lg or custom shadow utilities via className.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Responsive Behavior\n- Grid layouts: Sections use responsive grid classes to adapt from 1 column on small screens to multiple columns on larger screens.\n- Typography scaling: Titles and subtitles scale with screen size using responsive utilities.\n- Spacing: Padding and margin utilities adapt to small and large viewports.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Small[\"Small screen\"] --\u003e Grid1[\"1 column grid\"]\n  Medium[\"Medium screen\"] --\u003e Grid2[\"2 columns grid\"]\n  Large[\"Large screen\"] --\u003e Grid3[\"3 columns grid\"]\n  XL[\"Extra-large screen\"] --\u003e Grid4[\"4 columns grid\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Layout overflow on mobile:\n  - Cause: Excessively wide content or fixed widths inside cards.\n  - Resolution: Use responsive utilities (e.g., w-full, max-w-none) and avoid fixed widths; ensure overflow is handled with overflow-hidden or overflow-auto where appropriate.\n- Text cutoff or misalignment:\n  - Cause: Improper padding or spacing between header/title/content.\n  - Resolution: Use CardHeader/CardTitle/CardContent consistently to maintain spacing; adjust p-6 or pt-0 via className overrides if needed.\n- Shadow and elevation inconsistencies:\n  - Cause: Conflicting shadow utilities or theme mismatches.\n  - Resolution: Apply shadow-sm uniformly or shadow-lg selectively; verify theme tokens for card and background.\n- Contrast problems in dark mode:\n  - Cause: Low-contrast text against card backgrounds.\n  - Resolution: Use text-foreground or theme-aware text utilities; verify CSS variables for dark mode.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Card component provides a consistent, accessible foundation for displaying content across SpeakersSection, AgendaSection, and OrganizersSection. By leveraging Tailwind’s color tokens, spacing utilities, and responsive grids, developers can compose visually coherent cards with minimal effort. Proper use of className overrides and theme extensions enables flexible customization while maintaining accessibility and responsive behavior.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-f232bb77-d285-4495-89c2-fbafafb0ea2f","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":32343,"completion_tokens":3930,"total_tokens":36273,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
