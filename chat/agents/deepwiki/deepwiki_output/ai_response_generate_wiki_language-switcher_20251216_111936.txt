Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the LanguageSwitcher component that enables multilingual functionality across the application. Explain how it consumes the LanguageContext to access the current language state and setLanguage function, triggering re-renders across all translated components. Detail the implementation of dual presentation modes (floating and navbar) through the variant prop, adapting styling and positioning for different layouts. Describe the rendering logic for language options including emoji flags for English and Turkish, and a custom Syrian flag image for Arabic with appropriate RTL handling. Illustrate how clicking a language button updates the context state and automatically applies RTL layout when Arabic is selected. Include examples of integrating the switcher in different UI regions and styling considerations for accessibility and touch targets. Address common issues such as image loading failures, context update delays, and layout shifts during language change. Provide optimization tips for memoizing language options and lazy-loading flag assets.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nLanguage Switcher\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It details how the component consumes the LanguageContext to read the current language and update it via setLanguage, triggering re-renders across all translated components. It also covers the dual presentation modes (floating and navbar), flag rendering (emoji flags for English and Turkish, and a custom Syrian flag image for Arabic), and how selecting Arabic automatically applies RTL layout. Guidance is included for integrating the switcher in different UI regions, styling for accessibility and touch targets, and addressing common issues such as image loading failures, context update delays, and layout shifts during language change. Optimization tips for memoizing language options and lazy-loading flag assets are provided.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe LanguageSwitcher lives under src/components and integrates with the LanguageContext provider in the application root. The Navbar embeds the switcher in both desktop and mobile views. Global RTL and font selection logic are applied at the root level.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Root\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\"]\n    Provider[\"LanguageProvider\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageContext.tsx\"]\n    RootDiv[\"Root div with dir and font classes\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"UI Components\"\n    Navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n    LangSwitcher[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n    Sections[\"Sections using t()\"]\n  end\n\n  App --\u003e Provider\n  Provider --\u003e RootDiv\n  Navbar --\u003e LangSwitcher\n  RootDiv --\u003e Sections\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L122)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L122)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Core Components\n- LanguageSwitcher: Renders language options with flags and labels, updates the current language on click, and adapts styling based on variant.\n- LanguageContext: Provides language state, setLanguage, translation function t, and isRTL flag to consumers.\n- App: Applies RTL direction and font family based on the current language.\n- Navbar: Integrates the LanguageSwitcher in both desktop and mobile layouts.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L122)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe LanguageSwitcher reads the current language and setLanguage from the LanguageContext. Clicking a language button invokes setLanguage, which updates the state in LanguageProvider. This causes all components consuming useLanguage to re-render, reflecting the new language and RTL settings. The root App component sets dir and font classes based on isRTL and language, ensuring consistent layout and typography.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant

Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### LanguageSwitcher Component\n- Consumes useLanguage to access language and setLanguage.\n- Supports two variants:\n  - floating: Fixed positioning with a translucent, blurred background and shadow.\n  - navbar: Transparent background suitable for embedding in navigation bars.\n- Renders language options with:\n  - Emoji flags for English and Turkish.\n  - A custom Syrian flag image for Arabic.\n- Conditional label font:\n  - Non-Arabic languages use Roboto; Arabic uses the configured font stack.\n- Active state styling highlights the current language.\n- Accessibility:\n  - Buttons are interactive; consider adding explicit aria-labels if needed.\n  - Touch targets are padded via internal spacing classes.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Render

[LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n### LanguageContext and Translation System\n- LanguageContext defines the shape of the context: language, setLanguage, t, isRTL.\n- Initial language is Arabic.\n- t(key) returns localized text for the current language, falling back to the key if missing.\n- isRTL is true when language is Arabic.\n- Provider exposes the context to the app tree.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class LanguageContextType {\n    +language: Language\n    +setLanguage(lang): void\n    +t(key): string\n    +isRTL: boolean\n  }\n\n  class LanguageProvider {\n    +state: language\n    +setLanguage(lang): void\n    +t(key): string\n    +isRTL: boolean\n  }\n\n  LanguageProvider --\u003e LanguageContextType : \"provides\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### RTL and Typography Integration\n- App applies dir=\"rtl\" or dir=\"ltr\" based on isRTL.\n- App selects font-koufiya for Arabic and font-roboto for non-Arabic languages.\n- Tailwind config defines font families for koufiya and roboto.\n- index.css registers the Bahij Koufiya font faces and sets base font.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"App.tsx\"]) --\u003e GetLang[\"Get {isRTL, language} from LanguageContext\"]\n  GetLang --\u003e Dir{\"isRTL?\"}\n  Dir --\u003e|Yes| SetRTL[\"Set

LanguageSwitcher in desktop and mobile views.\n- Desktop: switcher is placed alongside navigation links.\n- Mobile: switcher appears inside the collapsible menu.\n- Uses isRTL to align content appropriately.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Navbar as \"Navbar.tsx\"\n  participant LS as \"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"\n  participant LCtx as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n\n

[Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L122)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L39)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- LanguageSwitcher depends on LanguageContext for language state and setLanguage.\n- App depends on LanguageContext for isRTL and language to set dir and font classes.\n- Navbar depends on LanguageContext for t and isRTL, and embeds LanguageSwitcher.\n- Tailwind config and index.css define fonts and base styles used by the app.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  LCtx[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e LS[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n

[tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L15-L20)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L22)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Memoize language options array to avoid recreating the list on each render. Wrap the languages array in useMemo if it becomes dynamic.\n- Lazy-load flag images if the number of languages grows to reduce initial payload.\n- Keep the LanguageSwitcher lightweight; avoid heavy computations in render.\n- Ensure the provider is high up in the tree to minimize re-renders of unrelated components.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Image loading failures for the Syrian flag:\n  - Verify the asset path and ensure the image is bundled. Confirm the alt text is descriptive.\n  - Consider adding an onError handler to display a fallback icon or placeholder.\n- Context update delays:\n  - The LanguageContext uses React state; updates are synchronous within the same render. If you observe perceived delays, ensure no heavy work is blocking the render thread.\n- Layout shifts during language change:\n  - Arabic text may wrap differently than English/Turkish. Use consistent spacing and avoid percentage-based widths for critical elements near the switcher.\n  - Consider setting a min-height on containers that may expand/shrink on language change.\n- RTL layout issues:\n  - Confirm dir is applied at the root and that CSS does not override directionality.\n  - Ensure icons and arrows are mirrored appropriately in RTL mode.\n- Accessibility:\n  - Add aria-labels to buttons if labels are not self-explanatory.\n  - Ensure sufficient touch target size (minimum 44px) and spacing between buttons.\n- PWA metadata:\n  - The manifest sets dir to rtl and lang to ar. If you add new languages, review the manifest’s lang and dir to reflect the default language.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L39)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [public/manifest.json](file://public/manifest.json#L1-L19)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe LanguageSwitcher is a compact, efficient component that integrates tightly with LanguageContext to provide seamless multilingual support. Its dual variants accommodate different UI layouts, while its flag rendering and conditional typography ensure cultural and linguistic fidelity. Combined with the root-level RTL and font logic, it delivers a cohesive internationalization experience across the application.\n\n[No sources needed since this section summarizes without analyzing specific files]\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Integration Examples\n- Floating variant:\n  - Place the switcher at the top-left corner of the viewport for quick access.\n  - Use the floating variant when the header is minimal or when the switcher should remain visible during scroll.\n- Navbar variant:\n  - Embed the switcher within the Navbar for desktop and mobile views.\n  - The Navbar already integrates the switcher in both contexts.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L39)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L78-L116)\n\n### Styling and Accessibility Checklist\n- Ensure each language button has adequate touch target size and spacing.\n- Provide aria-labels for buttons if labels are not descriptive enough.\n- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment across languages.\n- Test RTL layout thoroughly, especially for icons and adjacent components.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-5da77ed9-a057-4833-bdf2-5f4ae7c358b9","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":39193,"completion_tokens":3613,"total_tokens":42806,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
