Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for theme customization focused on modifying the sc-dof platform's visual appearance using Tailwind CSS. Explain how to extend the theme configuration in tailwind.config.ts by adding custom colors (such as syrian-red, syrian-green), fonts (Bahij Koufiya, Roboto), and breakpoints. Detail the process of integrating CSS variables for dynamic theming and dark mode support via the 'hsl(var(--color))' syntax. Provide practical examples from the codebase showing how the 'syrian' color palette and 'gold' accents are defined and applied across components. Address common issues such as ensuring RTL compatibility when styling Arabic text and maintaining responsive design across breakpoints. Include best practices for organizing custom styles, leveraging container queries, and extending utility classes without breaking existing UI components.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nTheme Customization\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

This documentation details the implementation of theme customization features including the Syrian color palette (syrian-red, syrian-green), custom typography (Bahij Koufiya, Roboto), and dynamic theming capabilities using CSS variables. The system supports dark mode, responsive layouts, and RTL compatibility for Arabic language content, providing a robust foundation for visual customization while maintaining accessibility and performance.\n\n## Theme Configuration\n\nThe theme configuration is centralized in `tailwind.config.ts`, which extends the default Tailwind configuration with custom design tokens. The configuration file defines the content sources, theme extensions, and plugins that power the visual system.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Tailwind Configuration] --\u003e B[Content Sources]\n    A --\u003e C[Theme Extension]\n    A --\u003e D[Plugins]\n    C --\u003e E[Colors]\n    C --\u003e F[Fonts]\n    C --\u003e G[Breakpoints]\n    C --\u003e H[Animations]\n    E --\u003e I[Syrian Palette]\n    E --\u003e J[Gold Accents]\n    F --\u003e K[Bahij Koufiya]\n    F --\u003e L[Roboto]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Custom Colors and CSS Variables\n\nThe platform implements a sophisticated color system using CSS variables in conjunction with Tailwind's `hsl(var(--color))` syntax, enabling dynamic theme switching and consistent color application across components. The custom color palette includes the Syrian national colors and gold accents that are applied throughout the interface.\n\nThe CSS variables are defined in `index.css` within the `:root` selector, establishing the light theme values, while the `.dark` class provides corresponding values for dark mode. This approach allows for seamless theme transitions without requiring changes to component-level styling.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class ColorSystem {\n        +--background\n        +--foreground\n        +--primary\n        +--secondary\n        +--syrian-red\n        +--syrian-green\n        +--gold\n        +--gold-light\n        +--cream\n    }\n    \n    class ThemeVariables {\n        +:root\n        +.dark\n    }\n    \n    ColorSystem --\u003e ThemeVariables : \"defined in\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L25-L127)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L20-L67)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L62-L67)\n\n## Font Integration\n\nThe platform integrates custom typography through the Bahij Koufiya font for Arabic text and Roboto for Latin scripts, ensuring cultural authenticity while maintaining readability. Font faces are defined in `index.css` using `@font-face` rules, and font families are registered in the Tailwind configuration for use as utility classes.\n\nThe font configuration supports both regular and bold weights of Bahij Koufiya, with appropriate font-display settings to ensure optimal loading performance. The font families are applied globally to the body element and selectively to interface components based on language context.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Font Definition] --\u003e B[Bahij Koufiya]\n    A --\u003e C[Roboto]\n    B --\u003e D[Regular Weight]\n    B --\u003e E[Bold Weight]\n    D --\u003e F[Woff Format]\n    D --\u003e G[TTF Format]\n    E --\u003e H[Woff Format]\n    E --\u003e I[TTF Format]\n    C --\u003e J[Google Fonts]\n    A --\u003e K[Font Registration]\n    K --\u003e L[tailwind.config.ts]\n    L --\u003e M[font-koufiya]\n    L --\u003e N[font-roboto]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L18)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L16-L19)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L18)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L16-L19)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36)\n\n## Dark Mode Support\n\nDark mode is implemented using Tailwind's class-based strategy with the `darkMode: [\"class\"]` configuration. The system uses CSS variables to define color values for both light and dark themes, allowing for smooth transitions and consistent styling across components without duplicating utility classes.\n\nThe color variables are defined in HSL format, which facilitates easy adjustment of hue, saturation, and lightness values between theme variants. This approach enables the creation of harmonious dark themes that maintain brand identity while improving readability in low-light environments.\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --\u003e LightMode\n    LightMode --\u003e DarkMode : \"dark class applied\"\n    DarkMode --\u003e LightMode : \"dark class removed\"\n    \n    LightMode : --background: 0 0% 100%\u003cbr/\u003e--foreground: 0 0% 10%\u003cbr/\u003e--syrian-red: 359 64% 46%\n    DarkMode : --background: 0 0% 8%\u003cbr/\u003e--foreground: 0 0% 95%\u003cbr/\u003e--syrian-red: 359 55% 50%\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L89-L127)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L4)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L89-L127)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L4)\n\n## Responsive Design and Breakpoints\n\nThe platform implements responsive design principles through Tailwind's breakpoint system and custom hooks for device detection. The mobile breakpoint is defined at 768px, with responsive layouts adapting to different screen sizes through utility classes and component logic.\n\nThe `useIsMobile` hook provides programmatic access to the current device state, enabling components to adjust their behavior based on screen size. This approach complements Tailwind's utility-first responsive classes, offering both declarative and imperative methods for creating adaptive interfaces.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    A[Screen Size] --\u003e B{Width \u003c 768px?}\n    B --\u003e|Yes| C[Mobile Layout]\n    B --\u003e|No| D[Desktop Layout]\n    C --\u003e E[Stacked Content]\n    C --\u003e F[Hidden Sidebar]\n    C --\u003e G[Mobile Menu]\n    D --\u003e H[Grid Layout]\n    D --\u003e I[Visible Sidebar]\n    D --\u003e J[Horizontal Nav]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L3-L19)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L11-L13)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L3-L19)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L11-L13)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L62-L77)\n\n## RTL Compatibility\n\nThe platform supports RTL (right-to-left) layout for Arabic language content through a combination of HTML `dir` attributes, CSS utilities, and React context. The `LanguageContext` provides the current language and directionality, which is applied to the document structure to ensure proper text alignment and component positioning.\n\nRTL compatibility is implemented at multiple levels, from the root HTML element to individual components, ensuring that text, navigation, and layout elements are properly mirrored for Arabic readers while maintaining the visual integrity of the design system.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Language Context] --\u003e B[isRTL Value]\n    B --\u003e C[HTML dir Attribute]\n    B --\u003e D[Component Styling]\n    C --\u003e E[Text Direction]\n    C --\u003e F[Layout Flow]\n    D --\u003e G[Padding/Margin]\n    D --\u003e H[Flex Direction]\n    D --\u003e I[Positioning]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L45)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L15)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L7-L8)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L15)\n\n## Utility Classes and Component Styling\n\nThe platform extends Tailwind's utility system with custom classes defined in the `@layer utilities` section of `index.css`. These include gradient backgrounds, glass morphism effects, and animation utilities that are applied consistently across components.\n\nThe component styling approach combines Tailwind's utility classes with semantic component structure, using the `cn` utility function to merge class names from multiple sources. This pattern enables the creation of reusable components with consistent styling while allowing for customization through props and context.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class UtilityClasses {\n        +gradient-hero\n        +gradient-gold\n        +gradient-green\n        +text-gradient\n        +glass\n        +glow-primary\n        +glow-gold\n        +animate-float\n        +animate-pulse-glow\n    }\n    \n    class ComponentStyling {\n        +Button\n        +Card\n        +HeroSection\n        +RegistrationSection\n    }\n    \n    UtilityClasses --\u003e ComponentStyling : \"applied to\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L249)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L87)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L85)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L249)\n- [lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L4-L6)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L27-L28)\n\n## Best Practices\n\nThe theme customization implementation follows several best practices for maintainable and scalable design systems:\n\n1. **CSS Variables for Theme Values**: Using CSS variables for color and spacing values enables dynamic theme switching and consistent updates across the application.\n\n2. **HSL Color Model**: The HSL color format facilitates the creation of color variants and ensures harmonious color relationships between light and dark themes.\n\n3. **Layered CSS Architecture**: The use of Tailwind's `@layer` directive organizes styles into base, components, and utilities, following a logical cascade and specificity hierarchy.\n\n4. **Font Loading Strategy**: The `font-display: swap` property ensures text remains visible during font loading, improving perceived performance.\n\n5. **Animation Performance**: CSS transforms and opacity are used for animations rather than properties that trigger layout recalculations, ensuring smooth performance.\n\n6. **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement ensures accessibility across devices.\n\n7. **Accessibility**: Sufficient color contrast and semantic HTML structure support users with visual impairments.\n\n8. **Code Organization**: Custom styles are organized in a logical structure that separates concerns and enables easy maintenance.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css)\n- [components.json](file://components.json)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe sc-dof platform's theme customization system demonstrates a sophisticated implementation of Tailwind CSS for creating a culturally resonant and visually cohesive user interface. By leveraging CSS variables, custom fonts, and responsive design principles, the system provides a flexible foundation for visual customization that supports both light and dark modes, multiple languages, and various screen sizes. The integration of Syrian national colors and traditional typography creates a distinctive identity while maintaining accessibility and performance standards. This approach serves as a model for implementing theme customization in modern web applications, balancing aesthetic considerations with technical best practices.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-c1bce7c8-426b-4640-a695-f959e8cbb3c0","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":26331,"completion_tokens":2883,"total_tokens":29214,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
