Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the internationalization system focused on the multilingual capabilities of the sc-dof platform. Explain the implementation of the LanguageContext that manages language state and provides the translation function (t) to all components. Detail how the LanguageSwitcher component enables users to switch between Arabic, English, and Turkish with proper flag indicators and visual feedback. Describe the RTL support mechanism that dynamically sets the document direction based on the selected language. Document the font switching logic between Koufiya (Arabic) and Roboto (English/Turkish). Include practical examples showing how components consume translations and respond to language changes. Address common i18n issues like text alignment in mixed-language layouts and provide troubleshooting guidance for translation loading problems.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nInternationalization System\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

[Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\n## Introduction\nThe sc-dof platform implements a comprehensive internationalization system supporting Arabic (ar), English (en), and Turkish (tr) languages. This system enables users to seamlessly switch between languages while maintaining proper typography, layout direction, and visual consistency. The architecture is built around React's Context API, providing a centralized language state management solution that propagates changes throughout the application. The system handles not only text translation but also critical aspects like right-to-left (RTL) layout for Arabic and appropriate font selection for each language.\n\n## Language Context Implementation\n\nThe internationalization system is centered around the `LanguageContext` implemented in `LanguageContext.tsx`. This context provides a unified interface for language management across all components. The context is defined with the `LanguageContextType` interface, which specifies the available properties and methods:\n\n- `language`: Current language code ('ar', 'en', or 'tr')\n- `setLanguage`: Function to update the language state\n- `t`: Translation function for retrieving localized strings\n- `isRTL`: Boolean flag indicating right-to-left layout requirement\n\nThe context is initialized with Arabic ('ar') as the default language. The `LanguageProvider` component wraps the application, making the context available to all descendants. The `useLanguage` hook provides a convenient way for components to access the context values. When the language is updated via `setLanguage`, React's state management triggers re-renders across all components that consume the context, ensuring immediate propagation of language changes.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class LanguageContextType {\n        +language: Language\n        +setLanguage(lang: Language): void\n        +t(key: string): string\n        +isRTL: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class LanguageProvider {\n        -language: Language\n        -setLanguage: (lang: Language) =\u003e void\n        +value: LanguageContextType\n        +children: ReactNode\n    }\n    \n    class useLanguage {\n        +returns: LanguageContextType\n    }\n    \n    LanguageProvider --\u003e LanguageContextType : \"provides\"\n    useLanguage --\u003e LanguageContextType : \"consumes\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L5-L10)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Translation System\n\nThe translation system is implemented through a comprehensive dictionary of localized strings organized by functional areas such as navigation, hero section, details, agenda, and others. The translations are structured as a nested object with language codes as top-level keys and dot-notation keys for specific strings. This hierarchical organization allows for logical grouping of related translations and easy maintenance.\n\nThe `t` function serves as the primary interface for components to retrieve translated strings. It accepts a key parameter and returns the corresponding translation based on the current language. The function includes a fallback mechanism that returns the key itself if a translation is missing, preventing blank text in the UI. This fail-safe approach ensures the application remains functional even when new translation keys are added without immediate translations.\n\nTranslation keys follow a consistent naming convention using dot-notation to indicate the component and specific string (e.g., 'nav.home', 'hero.title', 'agenda.1.title'). This systematic approach makes it easy to locate and manage translations. The system currently supports over 80 translation keys across the three languages, covering all major UI elements and content sections.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"Component calls t('key')\"] --\u003e B{\"Key exists in current language?\"}\n    B --\u003e|Yes| C[\"Return translated string\"]\n    B --\u003e|No| D[\"Return original key\"]\n    C --\u003e E[\"Render translated text\"]\n    D --\u003e E\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L264)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L272-L274)\n\n## Language Switcher Component\n\nThe `LanguageSwitcher` component provides a user interface for changing the application language. It supports two presentation modes through the `variant` prop: 'floating' (default) and 'navbar'. The floating variant appears as a fixed button in the top-left corner with a semi-transparent background, while the navbar variant integrates seamlessly into the navigation bar with a transparent background.\n\nThe component renders three language options: Arabic, English, and Turkish. Each option is represented by a button with visual indicators:\n- Arabic: Custom Syrian flag image\n- English: UK flag emoji (🇬🇧)\n- Turkish: Turkey flag emoji (🇹🇷)\n\nVisual feedback is provided through styling changes when a language is selected. The active language button displays a green background with white text, while inactive options show a subtle hover effect. The component consumes the `useLanguage` hook to access the current language state and the `setLanguage` function, ensuring immediate visual feedback when users switch languages.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant LanguageSwitcher\n    participant LanguageContext\n    participant UIComponents\n    \n    User-\u003e\u003eLanguageSwitcher: Click language button\n    LanguageSwitcher-\u003e\u003eLanguageContext: setLanguage(newLanguage)\n    LanguageContext-\u003e\u003eLanguageContext: Update language state\n    LanguageContext-\u003e\u003eUIComponents: Trigger re-renders\n    UIComponents-\u003e\u003eUIComponents: Update text with new translations\n    UIComponents-\u003e\u003eUIComponents: Adjust layout direction if needed\n    UIComponents-\u003e\u003eUIComponents: Change font if needed\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L283)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n## RTL Support and Layout Direction\n\nThe system implements robust RTL (right-to-left) support for Arabic language rendering. The `isRTL` flag is derived from the current language state in the `LanguageContext`, returning `true` when the language is set to 'ar' (Arabic) and `false` for English and Turkish. This boolean value is consumed throughout the application to dynamically adjust layout direction.\n\nIn the `App.tsx` file, the root component uses the `isRTL` flag to set the `dir` attribute on the main container element. This fundamental HTML attribute controls the base direction of text and layout for all child elements, ensuring proper text alignment, component positioning, and navigation flow. When Arabic is selected, the entire application flips to RTL mode, with text aligning to the right and interactive elements repositioned accordingly.\n\nThe system handles mixed-direction content gracefully, maintaining visual consistency across language switches. Components like `Navbar` and `LanguageSwitcher` specifically consume the `isRTL` flag to adjust their internal layout, ensuring optimal user experience in both LTR and RTL modes.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    A[Language Selection] --\u003e B{Language is Arabic?}\n    B --\u003e|Yes| C[Set isRTL = true]\n    B --\u003e|No| D[Set isRTL = false]\n    C --\u003e E[Apply dir='rtl' to root]\n    D --\u003e F[Apply dir='ltr' to root]\n    E --\u003e G[RTL Layout Rendering]\n    F --\u003e H[LTR Layout Rendering]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L13-L20)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L13-L20)\n\n## Font Management System\n\nThe platform implements a sophisticated font management system that automatically switches between different typefaces based on the selected language. This ensures optimal readability and cultural appropriateness for each language:\n\n- Arabic: Bahij Koufiya font\n- English and Turkish: Roboto font\n\nThe font switching logic is implemented in the `App.tsx` file, where a conditional expression determines the appropriate CSS class based on the current language. When Arabic is selected, the `font-koufiya` class is applied; for English and Turkish, the `font-roboto` class is used. This class is then applied to the root container element, cascading the font choice throughout the entire application.\n\nThe font families are defined in the `tailwind.config.ts` file, making them available as utility classes. The `index.css` file includes the `@font-face` declarations for Bahij Koufiya, specifying both regular and bold weights with WOFF and TTF formats for broad browser compatibility. The system uses `font-display: swap` to ensure text remains visible during font loading, preventing flash of invisible text (FOIT).\n\nThis font management approach ensures that Arabic text is rendered with a typeface designed specifically for Arabic script, providing proper glyph shaping and ligature support, while Latin script languages use the clean, modern Roboto font.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class FontConfiguration {\n        +koufiya: ['Bahij Koufiya', 'Cairo', 'sans-serif']\n        +roboto: ['Roboto', 'sans-serif']\n    }\n    \n    class FontFiles {\n        +Bahij_Koufiya-Regular.woff\n        +Bahij_Koufiya-Regular.ttf\n        +Bahij_Koufiya-Bold.woff\n        +Bahij_Koufiya-Bold.ttf\n    }\n    \n    class CSSClasses {\n        +font-koufiya\n        +font-roboto\n    }\n    \n    class AppLogic {\n        +language === 'ar' ?

The `Navbar` component demonstrates this integration pattern by using the `useLanguage` hook to access both the translation function (`t`) and the `isRTL` flag. Navigation links are translated using keys like 'nav.home', 'nav.why', and 'nav.goals', ensuring all text content adapts to the selected language.\n\nThe `HeroSection` component showcases translation usage for prominent content, with keys like 'hero.title', 'hero.subtitle', and 'hero.discoverMore'. These translations are applied to headings and call-to-action elements, making the core message accessible in all supported languages. The component also benefits from the automatic font and layout changes driven by the language context.\n\nMultiple components, including `GoalsSection` and `WhySection`, use the translation system to render content-specific text. The pattern is consistent: import the `useLanguage` hook, call the `t` function with appropriate keys, and render the returned string. This approach ensures that all text content is localized while maintaining the component's structural integrity.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Import useLanguage] --\u003e B[Call useLanguage hook]\n    B --\u003e C[Access t function and language state]\n    C --\u003e D[Use t('key') for text content]\n    D --\u003e E[Render translated text]\n    F[Language Change] --\u003e G[Context update]\n    G --\u003e H[Component re-render]\n    H --\u003e I[New translations applied]\n```\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L7-L28)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L7-L89)\n- [GoalsSection.tsx](file://src/components/GoalsSection.tsx#L7-L47)\n\n## Common i18n Issues and Troubleshooting\n\nWhen implementing internationalization, several common issues may arise. For translation loading problems, ensure that new translation keys are added to all language objects in `LanguageContext.tsx`. Missing keys will fall back to displaying the key itself, which should be addressed by completing the translations.\n\nRTL layout issues can occur when components have hardcoded positioning or when third-party libraries don't support RTL. Test the application thoroughly in Arabic mode to identify elements that don't align properly. Use the `dir` attribute and CSS logical properties to ensure consistent RTL behavior.\n\nFont display issues may appear if the font files are not properly loaded or if there are network problems. The system uses `font-display: swap` to mitigate this, but verify that the font files exist in the public/fonts directory and are correctly referenced in `index.css`.\n\nWhen adding new languages, extend the `Language` type union and add a new entry to the translations object. Ensure that RTL behavior is correctly configured for right-to-left languages by updating the `isRTL` calculation in `LanguageContext.tsx`.\n\nFor performance optimization, consider memoizing frequently used translation lookups and ensuring that components only re-render when necessary. The current context implementation may cause unnecessary re-renders; consider implementing memoization or using more granular state management for large applications.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe sc-dof platform's internationalization system provides a robust foundation for multilingual support, enabling users to seamlessly switch between Arabic, English, and Turkish. The system effectively manages language state, text translation, layout direction, and typography through a well-structured context-based architecture. By leveraging React's Context API and Tailwind CSS, the implementation ensures consistent behavior across all components while maintaining performance and usability. The modular design allows for easy extension to support additional languages and locales in the future.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-e11c24de-7d12-40cc-bfa3-5685a6c6bdbe","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":30142,"completion_tokens":3201,"total_tokens":33343,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
