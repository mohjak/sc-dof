Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for adding new languages to the sc-dof platform by extending the LanguageContext system. Explain the process of adding a new language option to the Language type union ('ar' | 'en' | 'tr') and expanding the translations object with a new language key and corresponding translation strings. Provide a step-by-step guide on how to ensure RTL support is properly handled when adding right-to-left languages. Demonstrate how to integrate the new language into the LanguageSwitcher component and maintain consistency across all UI elements using the t() translation function. Use practical examples from the codebase showing how Arabic (ar), English (en), and Turkish (tr) are currently implemented. Address common issues such as missing translation keys, fallback behavior, and maintaining UI alignment when switching languages. Include best practices for organizing translation keys, testing language switching functionality, and preserving accessibility standards across all language versions.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nAdding New Languages\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It details the process of integrating new language options into the existing internationalization framework, with specific focus on supporting right-to-left (RTL) languages like Arabic alongside left-to-right languages such as English and Turkish. The documentation covers the technical implementation steps, best practices for translation management, and strategies for maintaining UI consistency across language switches.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe sc-dof platform follows a component-based React architecture with a clear separation of concerns. Language-related functionality is centralized in the contexts directory, while UI components consume translations through the LanguageContext. The project structure shows a well-organized codebase with dedicated folders for components, contexts, hooks, and pages.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n    subgraph \"src\"\n        subgraph \"contexts\"\n            LanguageContext[LanguageContext.tsx]\n        end\n        \n        subgraph \"components\"\n            LanguageSwitcher[LanguageSwitcher.tsx]\n            Navbar[Navbar.tsx]\n            HeroSection[HeroSection.tsx]\n            AgendaSection[AgendaSection.tsx]\n            DetailsSection[DetailsSection.tsx]\n        end\n        \n        App[App.tsx]\n        main[main.tsx]\n    end\n    \n    LanguageContext --\u003e App\n    App --\u003e LanguageSwitcher\n    App --\u003e Navbar\n    LanguageSwitcher --\u003e Navbar\n    LanguageContext --\u003e HeroSection\n    LanguageContext --\u003e AgendaSection\n    LanguageContext --\u003e DetailsSection\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx)\n\n## Core Components\nThe internationalization system in sc-dof revolves around three core components: the LanguageContext which manages language state and provides translation functions, the LanguageSwitcher component that allows users to change languages, and the t() function that retrieves translated strings throughout the application. These components work together to provide a seamless multilingual experience.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L3-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe internationalization architecture in sc-dof follows the React Context pattern, providing a global state management solution for language preferences and translations. The LanguageProvider wraps the entire application, making language state available to all components through the useLanguage hook. When a user selects a new language via the LanguageSwitcher, the context updates, triggering re-renders across all components that consume translations.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[LanguageProvider] --\u003e B[App]\n    B --\u003e C[Navbar]\n    B --\u003e D[HeroSection]\n    B --\u003e E[AgendaSection]\n    B --\u003e F[DetailsSection]\n    B --\u003e G[Other Components]\n    H[LanguageSwitcher] --\u003e A\n    C --\u003e H\n    D --\u003e A\n    E --\u003e A\n    F --\u003e A\n    A --\u003e|Provides| I[language]\n    A --\u003e|Provides| J[setLanguage]\n    A --\u003e|Provides| K[t function]\n    A --\u003e|Provides| L[isRTL]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L283)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L36-L38)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L40)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Language Context Implementation\nThe LanguageContext is implemented using React's createContext and useContext hooks, providing a type-safe interface for language management. The context maintains the current language state, a translation function (t), and an isRTL flag that determines text direction.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class LanguageContextType {\n        +language: Language\n        +setLanguage: (lang: Language) =\u003e void\n        +t: (key: string) =\u003e string\n        +isRTL: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class LanguageProvider {\n        -language: Language\n        -setLanguage: (lang: Language) =\u003e void\n        +t: (key: string) =\u003e string\n        +isRTL: boolean\n        +value: LanguageContextType\n    }\n    \n    class useLanguage {\n        +returns: LanguageContextType\n    }\n    \n    LanguageProvider --\u003e LanguageContextType : \"implements\"\n    useLanguage --\u003e LanguageContextType : \"returns\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L5-L10)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### Translation System\nThe translation system is built around a nested object structure that organizes translations by language and functional area. Each language ('ar', 'en', 'tr') has its own set of key-value pairs following a dot-notation hierarchy (e.g., 'nav.home', 'hero.title'). The t() function serves as the primary interface for retrieving translations, with fallback behavior that returns the key itself when a translation is missing.\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n  TRANSLATIONS {\n    string ar PK\n    string en PK\n    string tr PK\n  }\n  \n  ARABIC {\n    string nav.home\n    string nav.why\n    string hero.title\n    string hero.subtitle\n    string details.title\n    string agenda.title\n  }\n  \n  ENGLISH {\n    string nav.home\n    string nav.why\n    string hero.title\n    string hero.subtitle\n    string details.title\n    string agenda.title\n  }\n  \n  TURKISH {\n    string nav.home\n    string nav.why\n    string hero.title\n    string hero.subtitle\n    string details.title\n    string agenda.title\n  }\n  \n  TRANSLATIONS ||--o{ ARABIC : \"contains\"\n  TRANSLATIONS ||--o{ ENGLISH : \"contains\"\n  TRANSLATIONS ||--o{ TURKISH : \"contains\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L264)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L264)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L7-L48)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L6-L24)\n\n### RTL Support\nThe platform provides built-in support for right-to-left languages through the isRTL flag in the LanguageContext. This flag is automatically set to true when the language is 'ar' (Arabic), triggering RTL layout throughout the application. The App component uses this flag to set the document direction, while specific components can access it for conditional styling.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Language Selection] --\u003e B{Language is 'ar'?}\n    B --\u003e|Yes| C[Set isRTL = true]\n    B --\u003e|No| D[Set isRTL = false]\n    C --\u003e E[Set dir='rtl' in HTML]\n    D --\u003e F[Set dir='ltr' in HTML]\n    E --\u003e G[Apply RTL-specific styles]\n    F --\u003e H[Apply LTR-specific styles]\n    G --\u003e I[Update font to Koufiya]\n    H --\u003e J[Update font to Roboto]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L13-L20)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L13-L20)\n\n### Language Switcher Component\nThe LanguageSwitcher component provides a user interface for changing languages, with visual indicators for each available language. It supports two presentation modes (floating and navbar) and handles both emoji flags for English and Turkish, and a custom Syrian flag image for Arabic.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant LanguageSwitcher\n    participant LanguageContext\n    participant UIComponents\n    \n    User-\u003e\u003eLanguageSwitcher: Click language button\n    LanguageSwitcher-\u003e\u003eLanguageContext: setLanguage(newLang)\n    LanguageContext-\u003e\u003eLanguageContext: Update language state\n    LanguageContext-\u003e\u003eLanguageContext: Update isRTL flag\n    LanguageContext-\u003e\u003eUIComponents: Trigger re-render\n    UIComponents-\u003e\u003eUIComponents: Update text with new translations\n    UIComponents-\u003e\u003eUIComponents: Adjust layout direction if needed\n    UIComponents-\u003e\u003eUIComponents: Change font if needed\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L40)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L7)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L13-L20)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L4-L8)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nThe internationalization system has well-defined dependencies between components, with the LanguageContext serving as the central hub. The dependency graph shows how language state flows from the provider to all consuming components, ensuring consistent behavior across the application.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[LanguageProvider] --\u003e B[App]\n    B --\u003e C[Navbar]\n    B --\u003e D[HeroSection]\n    B --\u003e E[AgendaSection]\n    B --\u003e F[DetailsSection]\n    B --\u003e G[Other Sections]\n    C --\u003e H[LanguageSwitcher]\n    H --\u003e A\n    D --\u003e A\n    E --\u003e A\n    F --\u003e A\n    G --\u003e A\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L36-L38)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L283)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L4-L5)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Performance Considerations\nThe current implementation efficiently manages language state using React Context, with minimal performance overhead. The translation object is defined once at the module level and reused across renders. The t() function provides fast key lookups with O(1) complexity. For large-scale applications, consider lazy-loading translation files or implementing code splitting for language-specific bundles.\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues when adding new languages include missing translation keys, incorrect RTL behavior, and font display problems. Always verify that new language entries are added to all relevant sections in the translations object. Test thoroughly with actual content to ensure proper text alignment and layout. Use the fallback behavior of the t() function to identify missing keys during development.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L273)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L16-L17)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe sc-dof platform provides a robust foundation for multilingual support through its well-structured LanguageContext system. Adding new languages requires updating the Language type union, expanding the translations object with new key-value pairs, and integrating the language into the LanguageSwitcher component. The system automatically handles RTL support for Arabic and font switching between Koufiya and Roboto. By following the patterns established in the existing implementation, new languages can be added consistently while maintaining UI integrity and accessibility standards.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-b8ddadd1-577a-475c-9609-998a4878de15","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":24931,"completion_tokens":2991,"total_tokens":27922,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
