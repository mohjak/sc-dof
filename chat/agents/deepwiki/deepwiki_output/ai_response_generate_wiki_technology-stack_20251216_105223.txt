Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the technology stack focused on the core frameworks and libraries powering the sc-dof application. Detail the role of React 18 with TypeScript in enabling type-safe component development, Vite for fast development server and build performance, and Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling. Explain how ShadCN UI components leverage Radix UI primitives for accessible UI elements. Document the configuration and integration of React Router DOM for client-side routing, React Query for data management, and date-fns for date manipulation. Include practical examples from the codebase showing how these technologies work together, such as using React Query in components or applying Tailwind classes in JSX.

Built with a robust technology stack, it leverages contemporary frontend tools and libraries to deliver a responsive, accessible, and maintainable user experience. This document details the core technologies powering the application, including React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, React Router DOM, React Query, and date-fns. It also explores how these technologies are integrated and configured to support the application's functionality and design goals.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx)\n\n## Core Frameworks and Libraries\nThe foundation of the sc-dof application is built on React 18 and TypeScript, providing a type-safe and component-driven development environment. React enables the creation of reusable UI components, while TypeScript enhances code quality by introducing static typing, reducing runtime errors, and improving developer tooling.\n\nTypeScript is configured through `tsconfig.json`, which sets up path aliases such as `@/` to resolve to the `src` directory, improving import readability and maintainability. The configuration also references separate app and node configurations, allowing for environment-specific compiler options.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[React 18] --\u003e B[Component-Based UI]\n    C[TypeScript] --\u003e D[Static Typing]\n    C --\u003e E[Enhanced Developer Experience]\n    B --\u003e F[Reusable Components]\n    D --\u003e G[Error Prevention]\n    E --\u003e H[Improved Tooling]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tsconfig.json](file://tsconfig.json)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L52-L54)\n- [tsconfig.json](file://tsconfig.json)\n\n## Development and Build Tools\nVite serves as the development server and build tool for the sc-dof application, offering fast startup times and efficient hot module replacement (HMR). Configured in `vite.config.ts`, Vite integrates with the React SWC plugin for faster compilation and includes a custom component tagger for development mode, enhancing debugging capabilities.\n\nThe development server is configured to run on port 8080 and supports IPv6 binding. Vite's configuration also sets up path aliases, allowing imports like `@/components` to resolve correctly, aligning with the TypeScript configuration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Vite] --\u003e B[Fast Development Server]\n    A --\u003e C[Optimized Build Process]\n    B --\u003e D[Near-Instant HMR]\n    C --\u003e E[Code Splitting]\n    C --\u003e F[Minification]\n    D --\u003e G[Improved Developer Experience]\n    E --\u003e H[Smaller Bundle Sizes]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L7-L11)\n\n## Styling and UI Components\nTailwind CSS provides utility-first styling, enabling developers to apply design tokens directly in JSX. The `tailwind.config.ts` file extends the default theme with custom colors, including Syrian national colors (`syrian-red`, `syrian-green`, `syrian-black`) and gold tones, as well as font families like Bahij Koufiya for Arabic text and Roboto for Latin scripts.\n\nThe application uses ShadCN UI components, which are built on Radix UI primitives to ensure accessibility and composability. These components are pre-styled with Tailwind classes and support dark mode via CSS variables. The `components.json` file configures the ShadCN CLI, specifying the use of TypeScript, Tailwind, and path aliases for consistent imports.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Button {\n        +variant: \"default\" | \"destructive\" | \"outline\" | \"secondary\" | \"ghost\" | \"link\"\n        +size: \"default\" | \"sm\" | \"lg\" | \"icon\"\n        +asChild: boolean\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class Card {\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    class Alert {\n        +variant: \"default\" | \"destructive\"\n        +className: string\n    }\n    \n    Button --\u003e \"1\" TailwindCSS : uses\n    Card --\u003e \"1\" TailwindCSS : uses\n    Alert --\u003e \"1\" TailwindCSS : uses\n    TailwindCSS --\u003e \"1\" Theme : extends\n    Theme --\u003e \"1\" tailwind.config.ts : configured in\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts)\n- [components.json](file://components.json)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts)\n- [components.json](file://components.json)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx)\n\n## Routing and Navigation\nReact Router DOM enables client-side routing, allowing navigation between views without full page reloads. In `App.tsx`, `BrowserRouter` wraps the application, and `Routes` define the route configuration. The application uses a catch-all route to handle 404 pages, ensuring a seamless user experience.\n\nNavigation is implemented through anchor tags with `onClick` handlers that prevent default behavior and use `scrollIntoView` for smooth scrolling to section anchors. This approach combines SPA routing with in-page navigation, enhancing usability.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[App] --\u003e B[BrowserRouter]\n    B --\u003e C[Routes]\n    C --\u003e D[Route: / → Index]\n    C --\u003e E[Route: * → NotFound]\n    F[Navbar] --\u003e G[scrollToSection]\n    G --\u003e H[document.querySelector]\n    H --\u003e I[scrollIntoView]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L5-L28)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L30-L36)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L5-L28)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx)\n\n## Data Management and State\nReact Query is used for data fetching, caching, and synchronization, reducing the need for manual state management. In `App.tsx`, a `QueryClient` is instantiated and provided to the application via `QueryClientProvider`, making it available to all components.\n\nWhile the current implementation does not show explicit data fetching, the setup enables components to use hooks like `useQuery` and `useMutation` for efficient API interactions. This pattern supports background refetching, error handling, and loading states with minimal boilerplate.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant App\n    participant QueryClientProvider\n    participant Component\n    participant API\n    \n    App-\u003e\u003eQueryClientProvider: Provide queryClient\n    QueryClientProvider-\u003e\u003eComponent: Enable useQuery/useMutation\n    Component-\u003e\u003eAPI: Fetch data\n    API--\u003e\u003eComponent: Return data\n    Component-\u003e\u003eQueryClient: Cache result\n    QueryClient--\u003e\u003eComponent: Provide data\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L4-L10)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L4-L10)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts)\n\n## Date and Time Utilities\nThe `date-fns` library is included as a dependency for date manipulation, though it is not currently used in the codebase. Instead, native JavaScript `Date` objects are used in components like `CountdownTimer.tsx` to calculate time differences for the event countdown.\n\nThe `eventData.ts` file contains the event date as a string (`\"2025-12-20\"`), which could be enhanced with `date-fns` for formatting, localization, and duration calculations. Integrating `date-fns` would allow for more robust date handling, especially for internationalization.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[CountdownTimer] --\u003e B[new Date()]\n    B --\u003e C[Calculate Time Difference]\n    C --\u003e D[Update State Every Second]\n    D --\u003e E[Display Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds]\n    F[date-fns] --\u003e G[Format Date]\n    F --\u003e H[Localize Date]\n    F --\u003e I[Calculate Duration]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L13-L27)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts)\n\n## Dependency Integration and Usage\nThe integration of core libraries is evident in the component structure and configuration files. For example, `AgendaSection.tsx` uses Tailwind classes like `bg-muted`, `text-foreground`, and `grid-cols-1` to style its layout and elements. The `cn` utility from `utils.ts` combines `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` to safely merge Tailwind classes, preventing style conflicts.\n\nShadCN UI components like `Toaster` and `TooltipProvider` are used in `App.tsx` to provide global UI functionality. These components leverage Radix UI under the hood, ensuring accessibility features like keyboard navigation and screen reader support.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[AgendaSection] --\u003e B[Tailwind Classes]\n    B --\u003e C[bg-muted]\n    B --\u003e D[text-foreground]\n    B --\u003e E[grid-cols-1]\n    F[utils.ts] --\u003e G[cn function]\n    G --\u003e H[clsx]\n    G --\u003e I[tailwind-merge]\n    H --\u003e J[Class Composition]\n    I --\u003e K[Style Conflict Resolution]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L3)\n\n## Common Issues and Optimization Tips\n### Version Conflicts\nThe `package.json` shows up-to-date versions of core libraries, minimizing the risk of version conflicts. However, when updating dependencies, it's essential to ensure compatibility between React, React DOM, and React Query, as breaking changes can occur between major versions.\n\n### Bundle Size Optimization\nTo reduce bundle size:\n- Use dynamic imports for routes or heavy components\n- Ensure only necessary Radix UI packages are installed\n- Optimize images and assets\n- Leverage Vite's built-in tree-shaking and code splitting\n\n### Performance Recommendations\n- Use React Query's caching to minimize network requests\n- Implement memoization with `React.memo` or `useMemo` for expensive calculations\n- Avoid inline functions in render props to prevent unnecessary re-renders\n- Use `React.lazy` for code splitting in larger applications\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json)\n- [vite.config.ts](file://vite.config.ts)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe sc-dof application demonstrates a modern, well-structured frontend architecture using React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and supporting libraries. The integration of ShadCN UI with Radix UI ensures accessible and consistent components, while React Router DOM and React Query provide robust navigation and data management. Although `date-fns` is not currently utilized, its inclusion suggests future plans for enhanced date handling. By following best practices in configuration and dependency management, the application is well-positioned for scalability and maintainability.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-79f96c65-53fd-451f-83c2-e4680e394d10","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":21917,"completion_tokens":2901,"total_tokens":24818,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
