Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive documentation for the LanguageSwitcher component that enables users to change the interface language between Arabic, English, and Turkish. Explain its two display variants (floating and navbar) controlled by the variant prop, and how it uses the useLanguage hook to access and update the current language state. Document the component's visual design including language buttons with flag emojis or Syrian flag image, active state highlighting with Syrian green background, and hover effects. Describe the conditional rendering of text labels (hidden on small screens) and font application (Roboto for non-Arabic languages). Explain the onClick handler that calls setLanguage and triggers re-rendering of all components using translation functions. Address RTL implications when Arabic is selected and provide implementation examples for both floating (fixed position) and embedded (navbar) usage patterns.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nLanguage Switcher\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers:\n- Two display variants: floating (fixed overlay) and navbar (embedded in navigation)\n- How it reads and updates the current language via the useLanguage hook\n- Visual design: flag indicators, active state highlighting, hover effects, and responsive text\n- Typography behavior: Roboto for non-Arabic languages and font switching at the app root\n- RTL implications when Arabic is selected\n- Practical usage patterns for both floating and navbar placements\n\n## Project Structure\nThe LanguageSwitcher lives under components and integrates with the internationalization system provided by LanguageContext.

consumed by LanguageSwitcher and the App root.\n- App: Applies directionality (dir) and font family based on current language.\n- Navbar: Embeds LanguageSwitcher in the navigation bar and passes variant=\"navbar\".\n\nKey behaviors:\n- Variant prop controls layout and background: floating (fixed overlay) vs navbar (embedded).\n- Active language is highlighted with a green background and contrasting text.\n- Hover effects use a semi-opaque green background.\n- Text labels are hidden on small screens and shown on medium screens and above.\n- Non-Arabic languages use Roboto; Arabic uses a custom font configured at the app root.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe LanguageSwitcher participates in a unidirectional data flow:\n- User clicks a language button\n- onClick invokes setLanguage(lang.code) from useLanguage\n- LanguageContext updates language state\n- All components consuming useLanguage re-render with new language values\n- App root applies RTL direction and font selection based on the new language\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant U as \"User\"\n  participant LS as \"LanguageSwitcher\"\n  participant Hook as \"useLanguage\"\n  participant Ctx as \"LanguageContext\"\n  participant App as \"App Root\"\n  participant UI as \"All Components\"\n\n  U-\u003e\u003eLS: Click language button\n  LS-\u003e\u003eHook: setLanguage(code)\n  Hook-\u003e\u003eCtx: setLanguage(code)\n  Ctx--\u003e\u003eCtx: Update language state\n  Ctx--\u003e\u003eHook: Provide {language, isRTL, t}\n  Hook--\u003e\u003eLS: Updated context values\n  Ctx--\u003e\u003eApp: Provider re-renders\n  App--\u003e\u003eUI: Apply dir and font class\n  UI--\u003e\u003eU: Translated content updated\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### LanguageSwitcher Component\nResponsibilities:\n- Render language options for Arabic, English, and Turkish\n- Use variant to switch between floating and navbar styles\n- Highlight active language and apply hover effects\n- Conditionally show labels and apply font classes\n- Trigger setLanguage on click\n\nVisual design highlights:\n- Flag indicators:\n  - English and Turkish use country flags\n  - Arabic uses a custom Syrian flag image\n- Active state:\n  - Green background and contrasting text for the selected language\n- Hover state:\n  - Semi-opaque green background for non-selected languages\n- Responsive text:\n  - Labels hidden on small screens; visible on medium screens and above\n- Typography:\n  - Non-Arabic languages use Roboto via font classes\n  - Arabic uses a custom font configured at the app root\n\nBehavioral flow for language selection:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Click language button\"]) --\u003e GetCode[\"Get language code from clicked option\"]\n  GetCode --\u003e CallSet[\"Call setLanguage(code)\"]\n  CallSet --\u003e UpdateCtx[\"LanguageContext updates state\"]\n  UpdateCtx --\u003e ReRender[\"Components re-render with new language\"]\n  ReRender --\u003e ApplyDir[\"App root applies RTL if Arabic\"]\n  ApplyDir --\u003e ApplyFont[\"App root applies font class\"]\n  ApplyFont --\u003e Done([\"Updated UI\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\nImplementation notes:\n- Variant prop:\n  - floating: fixed overlay with background blur and border\n  - navbar: transparent background suitable for embedding in navigation\n- Active and hover classes:\n  - Active uses a green background and foreground contrast\n  - Hover uses a semi-opaque green background\n- Conditional label visibility:\n  - Hidden on small screens; shown on medium screens and above\n- Font application:\n  - Non-Arabic languages receive Roboto via font classes\n  - Arabic uses a custom font configured at the app root\n\nUsage patterns:\n- Floating variant:\n  - Place LanguageSwitcher at the top-left corner of the page for a fixed overlay\n  - Example path: [Floating usage](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L19-L41)\n- Embedded (navbar) variant:\n  - Place LanguageSwitcher inside Navbar for seamless integration\n  - Example path: [Navbar integration](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L78-L82)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L78-L82)\n\n### LanguageContext and App Integration\n- LanguageContext provides:\n  - language: current language code\n  - setLanguage: updates language state\n  - t: translation function keyed by language\n  - isRTL: derived from language (true for Arabic)\n- App root applies:\n  - dir attribute based on isRTL\n  - font class based on language (Arabic uses a custom font; others use Roboto)\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class LanguageContext {\n    +language: Language\n    +setLanguage(lang)\n    +t(key): string\n    +isRTL: boolean\n  }\n\n  class AppRoot {\n    +dir: \"rtl\"|\"ltr\"\n    +fontClass: \"font-koufiya\"|\"font-roboto\"\n  }\n\n  class LanguageSwitcher {\n    +variant: \"floating\"|\"navbar\"\n    +onClick -\u003e setLanguage\n  }\n\n  LanguageSwitcher --\u003e LanguageContext : \"useLanguage()\"\n  LanguageContext --\u003e AppRoot : \"provider\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\n### Typography and Fonts\n- Tailwind configuration defines:\n  - font families: koufiya and roboto\n- App root applies:\n  - font-koufiya for Arabic\n  - font-roboto for English and Turkish\n- LanguageSwitcher also conditionally applies font classes for non-Arabic languages to ensure consistent typography across buttons and labels\n\nReferences:\n- [Tailwind font families](file://tailwind.config.ts#L16-L18)\n- [App font selection](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L17)\n- [LanguageSwitcher font classes](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36-L36)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L16-L18)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L17)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36-L36)\n\n### RTL Implications\n- isRTL is true when language is Arabic\n- App root sets dir=\"rtl\" for Arabic and dir=\"ltr\" otherwise\n- Navbar also respects isRTL for layout direction\n- LanguageSwitcher text labels are hidden on small screens to reduce layout shift during RTL transitions\n\nReferences:\n- [isRTL derivation](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276-L276)\n- [App dir attribute](file://src/App.tsx#L18-L18)\n- [Navbar dir attribute](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L45-L45)\n- [LanguageSwitcher responsive labels](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36-L36)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276-L276)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L18-L18)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L45-L45)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36-L36)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- LanguageSwitcher depends on:\n  - useLanguage hook from LanguageContext\n  - Local language list with codes, labels, and flags\n  - Tailwind classes for styling and responsive behavior\n- LanguageContext depends on:\n  - React’s createContext/useContext\n  - Internal translations object keyed by language\n- App depends on:\n  - LanguageContext for isRTL and language\n  - Tailwind classes for fonts and directionality\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  LCtx[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e LS[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  LCtx --\u003e App[\"App.tsx\"]\n  App --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  CSS --\u003e TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  NB[\"Navbar.tsx\"] --\u003e LS\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L84)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L84)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Keep language options static and memoized to avoid unnecessary renders\n- Lazy-load flag images if needed, though the Syrian flag is a small asset\n- Avoid heavy computations in onClick handlers; setLanguage is O(1)\n- Ensure responsive breakpoints align with Tailwind defaults to minimize layout thrashing\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n- Context not available:\n  - Ensure LanguageProvider wraps the application\n  - Verify useLanguage is used within the provider\n- Missing translation keys:\n  - The translation function falls back to the key itself if missing\n  - Add missing keys to the translations object\n- Image loading failures:\n  - Confirm the Syrian flag asset path is correct\n- Layout shifts during language change:\n  - Labels are hidden on small screens to reduce layout shifts\n  - Consider preloading fonts and assets\n- RTL layout inconsistencies:\n  - Confirm dir attribute is applied at the root and in navigation\n  - Ensure components respect isRTL for layout direction\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L285-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L18-L18)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L45-L45)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36-L36)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe LanguageSwitcher provides a clean, accessible way to switch languages with clear visual feedback. Its dual variants accommodate both overlay and embedded layouts, while the underlying LanguageContext ensures consistent updates across the app. Combined with App-level directionality and font selection, it delivers a robust internationalization experience.\n\n[No sources needed since this section summarizes without analyzing specific files]\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Implementation Examples\n- Floating variant (fixed overlay):\n  - Place LanguageSwitcher at the top-left corner with variant=\"floating\"\n  - Reference: [Floating variant usage](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L19-L41)\n- Embedded variant (navbar):\n  - Place LanguageSwitcher inside Navbar with variant=\"navbar\"\n  - Reference: [Navbar integration](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L78-L82)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L19-L41)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L78-L82)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-6e4cecba-fc77-420a-8d69-d675e412ea7b","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":38967,"completion_tokens":3737,"total_tokens":42704,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
