Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the Tailwind configuration focused on the custom theme extension in tailwind.config.ts. Explain how the theme extends default colors with Syrian community-specific palette (syrian-red, syrian-green, gold, cream) and custom fonts (Bahij Koufiya, Roboto). Detail the CSS variables defined in index.css that power the dynamic theming system and how they integrate with Tailwind's hsl() color functions. Describe the container configuration, border radius scaling, and keyframe animations for accordions. Document the integration of the tailwindcss-animate plugin and its role in providing smooth transitions. Include examples from the codebase showing how components leverage these custom configurations, such as the use of --gradient-hero in the HeroSection. Address common configuration issues like font loading strategies and provide optimization tips for reducing unused CSS.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nTailwind Configuration\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers how the theme extends default colors with a Syrian community palette, integrates custom fonts, defines CSS variables for dynamic theming, and configures containers, border radius scaling, and keyframes for smooth UI animations. It also documents the integration of the tailwindcss-animate plugin and demonstrates practical usage in components such as the HeroSection and Radix Accordion.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe Tailwind configuration is centralized in a single configuration file and backed by a global CSS layer that defines CSS variables for dynamic theming. The PostCSS pipeline applies Tailwind and Autoprefixer, while shadcn/ui components are configured to use the local Tailwind setup.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  A[\"tailwind.config.ts\"] --\u003e B[\"PostCSS Pipeline\u003cbr/\u003epostcss.config.js\"]\n  B --\u003e C[\"Tailwind CSS\"]\n  C --\u003e D[\"Generated CSS\"]\n  E[\"src/index.css\"] --\u003e C\n  F[\"components.json\"] --\u003e A\n  G[\"package.json\"] --\u003e C\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n\n## Core Components\n- Theme extension with custom colors and fonts:\n  - Custom palette keys include syrian red, syrian green, syrian black, gold, and cream.\n  - Custom font families include Bahij Koufiya and Roboto.\n- Dynamic theming via CSS variables:\n  - Base and dark mode variable sets define semantic tokens mapped to HSL values.\n  - Tailwind resolves color utilities by interpolating CSS variables into HSL().\n- Container sizing and responsive breakpoints:\n  - Centered container with a default padding and a 2xl breakpoint at 1400px.\n- Border radius scaling:\n  - Radius scales adapt to a central --radius variable for consistent corner treatment across components.\n- Keyframes and animations:\n  - Accordion animations use named keyframes and durations.\n  - Additional utility animations include floating, pulsing glow, shimmer, fade-up, scale-in, and confetti effects.\n- Plugin integration:\n  - tailwindcss-animate plugin enables utility classes for smooth transitions and animations.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe Tailwind pipeline transforms CSS variables into HSL-based color utilities and applies them across the app. The configuration extends default tokens and registers custom animations and typography. Components consume these utilities and animations directly.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Theme Layer\"\n    V1[\"CSS Variables\u003cbr/\u003e:root and .dark\"]\n    T1[\"Tailwind Theme\u003cbr/\u003ecolors, fonts, radii, keyframes\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Build Pipeline\"\n    P1[\"postcss.config.js\"]\n    TW[\"Tailwind CSS\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Components\"\n    C1[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n    C2[\"accordion.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  V1 --\u003e T1\n  T1 --\u003e TW\n  P1 --\u003e TW\n  TW --\u003e C1\n  TW --\u003e C2\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx#L1-L53)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Custom Theme Extension and Dynamic Theming\n- CSS variables define semantic tokens and gradients:\n  - Base tokens include background, foreground, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, border, input, and ring.\n  - Dark mode tokens mirror base tokens with adjusted HSL values.\n  - Custom tokens include syrian red, syrian green, syrian black, gold, gold-light, and cream.\n  - Predefined gradients use HSL values for hero, gold, and green themes.\n- Tailwind theme mapping:\n  - Colors resolve to HSL values derived from CSS variables.\n  - Fonts include Bahij Koufiya and Roboto families.\n  - Border radius scales derive from a central --radius variable.\n  - Accordion keyframes and animations are registered for smooth expand/collapse transitions.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Load Theme\"]) --\u003e DefineVars[\"Define CSS Variables\u003cbr/\u003eBase and Dark Mode\"]\n  DefineVars --\u003e ExtendTheme[\"Extend Tailwind Theme\u003cbr/\u003eColors, Fonts, Radii, Keyframes\"]\n  ExtendTheme --\u003e ResolveColors[\"Resolve Utilities\u003cbr/\u003ehsl(var(--token))\"]\n  ResolveColors --\u003e ApplyUtilities[\"Apply to Components\u003cbr/\u003eClasses and Utilities\"]\n  ApplyUtilities --\u003e End([\"Dynamic Theming Active\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n### Container Configuration and Responsive Behavior\n- Container centering and padding:\n  - The container is centered with a default padding and a 2xl breakpoint at 1400px.\n- Impact:\n  - Ensures consistent content width and spacing across screen sizes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L8-L14)\n\n### Border Radius Scaling\n- Centralized radius variable:\n  - A single --radius controls lg, md, and sm radius variants with small adjustments.\n- Benefits:\n  - Consistent corner rounding across components and easy global tuning.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L75-L79)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L59-L59)\n\n### Keyframe Animations and Accordion Integration\n- Accordion animations:\n  - Named keyframes for accordion-down and accordion-up use a Radix-specific content height variable.\n  - Duration and easing are defined for smooth transitions.\n- Component usage:\n  - The AccordionContent applies data-state-driven animations to animate open/close states.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant U as \"User\"\n  participant A as \"AccordionContent\"\n  participant R as \"Radix Accordion\"\n  participant T as \"Tailwind Theme\"\n  participant P as \"PostCSS Pipeline\"\n\n  U-\u003e\u003eR: Click trigger\n  R-\u003e\u003eA: Update data-state (open/closed)\n  A-\u003e\u003eT: Apply animation class based on data-state\n  T-\u003e\u003eP: Emit CSS with keyframes and durations\n  P--\u003e\u003eA: Render smooth height transition\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx#L1-L53)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L80-L93)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L80-L93)\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx#L1-L53)\n\n### Integration of tailwindcss-animate Plugin\n- Purpose:\n  - Provides utility classes for transitions and animations, enabling consistent motion across components.\n- Configuration:\n  - The plugin is enabled in the Tailwind configuration.\n- Practical usage:\n  - Components can apply animation utilities to achieve smooth state changes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L96-L96)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L61-L61)\n\n### Custom Fonts and Typography\n- Font families:\n  - Bahij Koufiya and Roboto are registered as custom font families.\n- Global application:\n  - Body text defaults to the Bahij Koufiya font family via base layer utilities.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L16-L19)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L130-L142)\n\n### CSS Variables and HSL Color Functions\n- Variable definitions:\n  - Semantic tokens and custom colors are defined in :root and .dark.\n  - Gradients and shadows use HSL values for consistent theming.\n- Tailwind resolution:\n  - Tailwind resolves color utilities by interpolating CSS variables into HSL(), enabling dynamic theming without rebuilding.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L24-L127)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L21-L73)\n\n### Practical Usage Examples from the Codebase\n- HeroSection:\n  - Uses gradient utilities and color tokens for visual impact.\n  - Applies utility animations for decorative effects.\n  - References custom tokens for confetti colors and gradient backgrounds.\n- Accordion:\n  - Leverages data-state attributes to drive animation classes for smooth expand/collapse.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant HS as \"HeroSection.tsx\"\n  participant CSS as \"src/index.css\"\n  participant TW as \"tailwind.config.ts\"\n\n  HS-\u003e\u003eCSS: Apply gradient-hero and utility animations\n  CSS-\u003e\u003eTW: Resolve HSL tokens and gradients\n  TW--\u003e\u003eHS: Emit themed CSS classes\n  HS--\u003e\u003eHS: Render with syrian-red, syrian-green, and gold accents\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L143-L172)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L54-L73)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx#L1-L53)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Tailwind configuration depends on:\n  - CSS variables for dynamic theming.\n  - PostCSS pipeline for processing Tailwind directives.\n  - shadcn/ui configuration pointing to the local Tailwind config and CSS.\n- Plugins:\n  - tailwindcss-animate is installed and enabled in the Tailwind config.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  CFG[\"tailwind.config.ts\"] --\u003e PLG[\"tailwindcss-animate\"]\n  CFG --\u003e CSSVARS[\"CSS Variables\u003cbr/\u003eindex.css\"]\n  CFG --\u003e PIPE[\"postcss.config.js\"]\n  SHADCN[\"components.json\"] --\u003e CFG\n  PKG[\"package.json\"] --\u003e PLG\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [postcss.config.js](file://postcss.config.js#L1-L7)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L61-L61)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L61-L61)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Reduce unused CSS:\n  - Ensure content paths in the Tailwind configuration match your project structure to avoid scanning unnecessary files.\n  - Keep font assets minimal and only include weights/styles you use.\n- Optimize animations:\n  - Prefer transform and opacity for hardware-accelerated animations.\n  - Limit heavy effects on low-end devices by adjusting durations and frequencies.\n- CSS variable updates:\n  - Centralize theme tokens to minimize cascade complexity and improve cacheability.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Fonts not loading:\n  - Verify font-face declarations and file paths in the global CSS.\n  - Confirm font-display strategy for improved perceived performance.\n- Colors appear incorrect in dark mode:\n  - Ensure .dark variables are defined and correctly mapped to HSL values.\n  - Check that the darkMode strategy is set to class in the Tailwind config.\n- Accordion animations not working:\n  - Confirm data-state attributes are present on the AccordionContent element.\n  - Ensure the tailwindcss-animate plugin is installed and enabled.\n- Unused CSS bloat:\n  - Adjust content globs in the Tailwind config to scan only relevant directories.\n  - Remove unused color and utility classes from components.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx#L1-L53)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L61-L61)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe Tailwind configuration establishes a cohesive, dynamic theming system by combining CSS variables with Tailwind’s HSL-based color resolution. It extends default tokens with a Syrian community palette, integrates custom fonts, and provides consistent container sizing, border radius scaling, and smooth animations. The tailwindcss-animate plugin enhances motion design, while the PostCSS pipeline ensures efficient CSS generation. Components like HeroSection and Radix Accordion demonstrate practical usage of these customizations.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-1e4e9566-d979-43ad-bdb6-975c69e6c229","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":20903,"completion_tokens":3260,"total_tokens":24163,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
