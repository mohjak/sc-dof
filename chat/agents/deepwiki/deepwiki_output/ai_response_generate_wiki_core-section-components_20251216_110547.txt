Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the core section components that define the event website's primary content flow.

It covers how each section consumes data from the centralized event data source and uses translation via the LanguageContext provider. It also describes responsive layout techniques using Tailwind CSS, common issues such as content overflow and image loading, accessibility considerations, and best practices for extending the template for future events.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe event website is organized around a set of dedicated section components rendered in sequence on the home page. The global language and translation system is provided by a context provider, and each section uses the t() function to render localized content. The event data is centralized in a single data module consumed by sections and the navigation.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Shell\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\"]\n    Provider[\"LanguageProvider\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageContext.tsx\"]\n    Router[\"React Router\"]\n    Index[\"Index.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Sections\"\n    Hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n    Why[\"WhySection.tsx\"]\n    Goals[\"GoalsSection.tsx\"]\n    Details[\"DetailsSection.tsx\"]\n    Agenda[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n    Speakers[\"SpeakersSection.tsx\"]\n    Organizers[\"OrganizersSection.tsx\"]\n    Registration[\"RegistrationSection.tsx\"]\n    Footer[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  App --\u003e Provider\n  App --\u003e Router\n  Router --\u003e Index\n  Index --\u003e Hero\n  Index --\u003e Why\n  Index --\u003e Goals\n  Index --\u003e Details\n  Index --\u003e Agenda\n  Index --\u003e Speakers\n  Index --\u003e Registration\n  Index --\u003e Organizers\n  Index --\u003e Footer\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Core Components\nEach section component follows a consistent pattern:\n- Consume the LanguageContext via the useLanguage hook to access t() and language.\n- Render localized content using translation keys.\n- Use Tailwind classes for responsive layouts (grid, flex, spacing).\n- Reference assets and constants where applicable.\n\nKey data sources:\n- Centralized event data is defined in a single module and consumed by sections.\n- Translation keys are defined in the LanguageContext and mapped per language.\n\nResponsive layout techniques:\n- Grid-based cards for Goals, Agenda, Speakers, and Details.\n- Flexbox for alignment and centering.\n- Container-based max widths and auto margins for centering content.\n- Responsive breakpoints (sm, md, lg) to adapt to screen sizes.\n\nAccessibility:\n- Alt text on images.\n- Semantic headings and landmarks.\n- Focus-visible styles via Tailwind utilities.\n- Proper contrast and color roles.\n\nCommon issues and mitigations:\n- Content overflow: constrained containers and max-widths; overflow-hidden on sections where needed.\n- Image loading: lazy loading via asset imports; fallback placeholders; object-fit utilities.\n- Accessibility: aria-labels for links; semantic HTML; color contrast checks.\n\nBest practices for extension:\n- Add new translation keys to LanguageContext.\n- Extend eventData with new fields and map them in sections.\n- Reuse shared UI components (e.g., Button) for CTAs.\n- Keep responsive patterns consistent across sections.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe sections are composed in a linear flow on the home page. Each section reads from the LanguageContext for localization and from eventData for content. The app shell sets up routing and the language provider.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Browser as \"Browser\"\n  participant App as \"App.tsx\"\n  participant Provider as

Considerations\n- Asset imports: Images are bundled with the build; ensure appropriate sizes and formats for fast loading.\n- Animations: Keep the number of animated confetti pieces reasonable to avoid jank.\n- Grid layouts: Prefer CSS Grid for complex layouts; avoid excessive reflows by minimizing dynamic content inside grids.\n- Lazy loading: For large image galleries, consider lazy loading strategies; for current assets, rely on bundling.\n- Font rendering: The app switches fonts based on language; ensure font weights and fallbacks are configured.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Content overflow:\n  - Use container utilities and max-width constraints.\n  - Apply overflow-hidden on parent containers when necessary.\n- Image loading:\n  - Ensure alt attributes are present for accessibility.\n  - Use object-fit utilities for consistent cropping.\n- Accessibility:\n  - Verify ARIA labels for external links.\n  - Confirm keyboard focus visibility.\n- Localization:\n  - Ensure translation keys exist for all languages.\n  - Validate that language switching updates all sections.\n\n**Section
