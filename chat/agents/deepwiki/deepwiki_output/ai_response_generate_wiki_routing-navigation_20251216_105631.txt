Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the routing and navigation system focused on how users move through the application.

It focuses on:\n- React Router DOM setup in App.tsx with the main Index page and a NotFound fallback\n- Navbar navigation links and smooth scrolling to page sections\n- ScrollToTop behavior for returning users to the top of the page\n- Single-page application (SPA) patterns and how navigation works without full page reloads\n- Solutions for common navigation issues such as hash routing conflicts and accessibility compliance\n\n## Project Structure\nThe routing and navigation system spans several files:\n- App.tsx sets up the SPA with BrowserRouter, Routes, and two routes: root \"/\" and catch-all \"*\"\n- Index.tsx composes the main page with Navbar, sections, and ScrollToTop\n- Navbar.tsx provides desktop/mobile navigation and smooth scrolling to sections\n- ScrollToTop.tsx adds a floating button to scroll back to the top\n- NavLink.tsx wraps react-router-dom’s NavLink to support active/pending styling\n- HeroSection.tsx defines the anchor target for the hero section\n- utils.ts provides the cn utility used by NavLink\n- main.tsx bootstraps the app\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  main_tsx[\"src/main.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eBootstraps the app\"] --\u003e app_tsx[\"src/App.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eBrowserRouter + Routes\"]\n  app_tsx --\u003e index_tsx[\"src/pages/Index.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eMain page composition\"]\n  index_tsx --\u003e navbar_tsx[\"src/components/Navbar.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eNavigation + smooth scroll\"]\n  index_tsx --\u003e scroll_to_top_tsx[\"src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eScroll to top\"]\n  index_tsx --\u003e hero_section_tsx[\"src/components/HeroSection.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eSection anchor 'hero'\"]\n  navbar_tsx --\u003e hero_section_tsx\n  app_tsx --\u003e not_found_tsx[\"src/pages/NotFound.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eCatch-all fallback\"]\n  navlink_tsx[\"src/components/NavLink.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eActive/pending styling\"] -.-\u003e app_tsx\n  utils_tsx[\"src/lib/utils.ts\u003cbr/\u003ecn utility\"] -.-\u003e navlink_tsx\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [NotFound.tsx](file://src/pages/NotFound.tsx#L1-L25)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L29)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Core Components\n- App.tsx: Wraps the app with providers and defines the SPA routes. The root route renders Index, and the catch-all \"*\" renders NotFound.\n- Index.tsx: Composes the main page and includes Navbar, sections, and ScrollToTop.\n- Navbar.tsx: Provides navigation links and smooth scrolling to sections via hash anchors.\n- ScrollToTop.tsx: Shows a floating button when scrolled down and smoothly scrolls to the top.\n- NavLink.tsx: A wrapper around react-router-dom’s NavLink that supports active/pending styling using the cn utility.\n- HeroSection.tsx: Defines the anchor target for the hero section so Navbar links can scroll to it.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L29)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe application is a single-page application powered by React Router DOM. BrowserRouter enables client-side routing without full page reloads. The Index page composes all visible sections and integrates navigation helpers.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Browser as \"Browser\"\n  participant Router as \"BrowserRouter\"\n  participant Routes as \"Routes\"\n  participant Index as \"Index\"\n  participant NotFound as \"NotFound\"\n\n  Browser-\u003e\u003eRouter: Navigate to \"/\"\n  Router-\u003e\u003eRoutes: Match path \"/\"\n  Routes--\u003e\u003eIndex: Render Index\n\n  Browser-\u003e\u003eRouter: Navigate to \"/nonexistent\"\n  Router-\u003e\u003eRoutes: No match for \"/nonexistent\"\n  Routes--\u003e\u003eNotFound: Render NotFound fallback\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [NotFound.tsx](file://src/pages/NotFound.tsx#L1-L25)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### React Router DOM Implementation\n- BrowserRouter is mounted at the root to enable client-side routing.\n- Routes contains two routes:\n  - Root path \"/\" renders Index\n  - Catch-all \"*\" renders NotFound\n- Providers (QueryClientProvider, TooltipProvider, LanguageProvider) wrap the routing tree, ensuring global state and i18n are available to all routed components.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"App render\"]) --\u003e Providers[\"Providers wrap\u003cbr/\u003eBrowserRouter\"]\n  Providers --\u003e Router[\"BrowserRouter\"]\n  Router --\u003e RoutesComp[\"Routes\"]\n  RoutesComp --\u003e RootRoute[\"Route '/' -\u003e Index\"]\n  RoutesComp --\u003e Fallback[\"Route '*' -\u003e NotFound\"]\n  RootRoute --\u003e End([\"SPA navigation\"])\n  Fallback --\u003e End\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n### Navbar Component Navigation\n- Responsive design:\n  - Desktop: Horizontal navigation bar with LanguageSwitcher\n  - Mobile: Collapsible menu with LanguageSwitcher inside\n- Navigation links:\n  - Each link targets a section via hash anchors (e.g., \"#hero\", \"#why\", \"#goals\", etc.)\n  - Click handlers prevent default navigation and call scrollToSection to smoothly scroll to the target element\n- Smooth scrolling:\n  - Uses Element.scrollIntoView with smooth behavior\n  - Ensures the mobile menu closes after navigation\n- Accessibility:\n  - Uses aria-label on the mobile menu toggle button\n  - Inherits directionality (LTR/RTL) from the LanguageContext\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Navbar as \"Navbar\"\n  participant DOM as \"DOM Elements\"\n  participant Window as \"Window\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Click a nav link (e.g., \"#why\")\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eNavbar: preventDefault()\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eDOM: querySelector(\"#why\")\n  DOM--\u003e\u003eNavbar: Element or null\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eWindow: Element.scrollIntoView({ behavior: \"smooth\" })\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eNavbar: setIsMobileMenuOpen(false)\n  Window--\u003e\u003eUser: Smooth scroll to section\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n\n### ScrollToTop Component\n- Visibility logic:\n  - Listens to scroll events and toggles visibility when scroll position exceeds a threshold\n  - Unsubscribes from scroll events on cleanup to prevent memory leaks\n- Smooth scroll to top:\n  - Uses window.scrollTo with smooth behavior\n- Accessibility:\n  - Provides an aria-label for screen readers\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Mount ScrollToTop\"]) --\u003e Listen[\"Add scroll listener\"]\n  Listen --\u003e Check[\"On scroll: compare scrollY to threshold\"]\n  Check --\u003e Visible{\"Over threshold?\"}\n  Visible --\u003e|Yes| Show[\"Set isVisible = true\"]\n  Visible --\u003e|No| Hide[\"Set isVisible = false\"]\n  Show --\u003e Click[\"User clicks button\"]\n  Hide --\u003e Click\n  Click --\u003e Scroll[\"window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })\"]\n  Scroll --\u003e Cleanup[\"Remove scroll listener on unmount\"]\n  Cleanup --\u003e End([\"Unmounted\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n### NavLink Component for Active States\n- Wraps react-router-dom’s NavLink to support dynamic className composition\n- Uses the cn utility to merge Tailwind classes and resolve conflicts\n- Exposes activeClassName and pendingClassName for styling active/pending states\n- Maintains ref forwarding for accessibility and integration\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class NavLinkWrapper {\n    +props: NavLinkCompatProps\n    +render(): ReactElement\n  }\n  class RouterNavLink {\n    +to: string\n    +className(getters): string\n  }\n  class UtilsCN {\n    +cn(...inputs): string\n  }\n  NavLinkWrapper --\u003e RouterNavLink : \"renders\"\n  NavLinkWrapper --\u003e UtilsCN : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L29)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L29)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n### Navigation Patterns in the SPA\n- Hash-based navigation:\n  - Navbar links use hash anchors to navigate within the same page\n  - HeroSection defines the anchor target for the hero section\n- SPA behavior:\n  - BrowserRouter prevents full page reloads; navigation updates the URL and re-renders components\n- Fallback handling:\n  - NotFound is rendered for unmatched routes, logging the attempted path for diagnostics\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Navbar as \"Navbar\"\n  participant Router as \"BrowserRouter\"\n  participant Index as \"Index\"\n  participant NotFound as \"NotFound\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Click \"#details\"\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eRouter: preventDefault + scrollToSection\n  Router--\u003e\u003eIndex: No route change (SPA)\n  User-\u003e\u003eRouter: Enter \"/nonexistent\"\n  Router--\u003e\u003eNotFound: Render fallback\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [NotFound.tsx](file://src/pages/NotFound.tsx#L1-L25)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [NotFound.tsx](file://src/pages/NotFound.tsx#L1-L25)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- External dependencies:\n  - react-router-dom provides BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, and NavLink\n  - lucide-react provides icons used in Navbar and ScrollToTop\n  - @tanstack/react-query provides QueryClientProvider\n- Internal dependencies:\n  - App.tsx depends on Index and NotFound\n  - Index.tsx composes Navbar, sections, and ScrollToTop\n  - Navbar.tsx depends on LanguageContext and uses hash anchors\n  - ScrollToTop.tsx depends on window scroll events\n  - NavLink.tsx depends on utils.cn\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  pkg[\"package.json\u003cbr/\u003ereact-router-dom, lucide-react, @tanstack/react-query\"] --\u003e app[\"App.tsx\"]\n  app --\u003e index[\"Index.tsx\"]\n  index --\u003e navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n  index --\u003e scroll[\"ScrollToTop.tsx\"]\n  index --\u003e hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n  navbar --\u003e utils[\"utils.ts\"]\n  navlink[\"NavLink.tsx\"] --\u003e utils\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L29)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Scroll event listeners:\n  - Both Navbar and ScrollToTop attach scroll listeners. Ensure cleanup on unmount to avoid memory leaks (already handled).\n- Smooth scrolling:\n  - Using Element.scrollIntoView with smooth behavior is efficient for short distances; for very long pages, consider virtualization or throttling if performance becomes an issue.\n- Router overhead:\n  - SPA routing avoids full page reloads, reducing network and rendering costs.\n- Bundle size:\n  - react-router-dom and lucide-react are lightweight; keep imports scoped to reduce bundle bloat.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n\n### Hash Routing Conflicts\nSymptoms:\n- Unexpected fragment navigation or jumping to sections unexpectedly\n- Conflicts when sharing URLs with external fragments\n\nSolutions:\n- Ensure hash anchors in Navbar match section ids in the page (e.g., \"#hero\" matches the hero section id)\n- Avoid using hash anchors for actual routes; rely on BrowserRouter for route changes and hash anchors only for in-page navigation\n- If deep linking to sections is required, consider updating the URL fragment after navigation to reflect the current section\n\nEvidence from code:\n- Navbar links use hash anchors to target sections\n- HeroSection defines the anchor target for the hero section\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n\n### Accessibility Compliance\nCommon issues:\n- Missing labels for interactive elements\n- Poor focus management on mobile menus\n- Low contrast or small text in navigation\n\nSolutions:\n- Navbar:\n  - aria-label is present on the mobile menu toggle button\n  - Ensure links have meaningful text and consider adding aria-current for active states (NavLink supports active styling)\n- ScrollToTop:\n  - aria-label is present for screen readers\n- General:\n  - Ensure sufficient color contrast and focus indicators\n  - Test keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab) through the Navbar and mobile menu\n  - Verify that smooth scrolling does not cause motion sensitivity issues; users can disable animations if needed\n\nEvidence from code:\n- Navbar mobile menu toggle has aria-label\n- ScrollToTop button has aria-label\n- NavLink supports active/pending styling for better focus semantics\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L1-L29)\n\n### Route Ordering and Fallback Behavior\n- Place specific routes before the catch-all \"*\" route to avoid unintended fallbacks\n- NotFound logs the attempted pathname for debugging\n\nEvidence from code:\n- App.tsx comments indicate route ordering and fallback handling\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [NotFound.tsx](file://src/pages/NotFound.tsx#L1-L25)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe routing and navigation system combines React Router DOM for SPA behavior with in-page hash-based navigation for smooth scrolling. Navbar and ScrollToTop provide intuitive user experiences, while NavLink enhances visual feedback for active states. By following the patterns outlined here—matching hash anchors to section ids, cleaning up event listeners, and maintaining accessibility—you can extend the navigation system reliably and inclusively.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-a28c5c5d-10af-41c8-9947-f17c571edb31","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":26257,"completion_tokens":3972,"total_tokens":30229,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
