Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive documentation for the SpeakersSection component that showcases event participants. Detail how it retrieves speaker data from a centralized speakers array and dynamically selects name and role based on the current language (Arabic, English, Turkish) using the getName and getRole helper functions. Explain the responsive grid layout that adapts from 1 to 4 columns based on screen size, and document the card design including circular image containers with ring effects, hover interactions, and fade-up animations with staggered delays. Describe the fallback avatar system for speakers without images and accessibility features like proper alt text generation. Address internationalization challenges in name rendering and provide examples of how speaker data should be structured in the source file. Include performance tips for image optimization and lazy loading if implemented.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nSpeakers Section\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers how speaker data is organized, how multilingual names and roles are selected, the responsive grid layout, card design and interactions, fallback avatar handling, accessibility features, and internationalization considerations. It also provides guidance on structuring speaker data and optimizing images.\n\n## Project Structure\nSpeakersSection is a self-contained component that:\n- Imports localized strings from the LanguageContext provider\n- Uses a typed speakers array with Arabic, English, and Turkish fields\n- Renders a responsive grid of speaker cards with hover and animation effects\n- Provides a fallback avatar when an image is missing\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  LC[\"LanguageContext\u003cbr/\u003eprovides t(language)\"] --\u003e SS[\"SpeakersSection\"]\n  SS --\u003e Grid[\"Responsive Grid\u003cbr/\u003e1–4 columns\"]\n  Grid --\u003e Card[\"Speaker Card\u003cbr/\u003eCircular image + ring + hover\"]\n  Card --\u003e Img[\"Image or Fallback Avatar\"]\n  Card --\u003e Text[\"Name + Role\u003cbr/\u003eLocalized\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L235)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L231-L249)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L238)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n## Core Components\n- SpeakersSection: Renders the section header and the grid of speaker cards. It selects localized name and role via helper functions and applies responsive grid and animation classes.\n- LanguageContext: Provides the translation function t and language state used by SpeakersSection.\n- index.css: Supplies the fade-up animation keyframes and delay utilities used by the component.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n- Localized display: getName and getRole pick the correct field based on the current language.\n- Responsive layout: Tailwind grid classes adapt from 1 to 4 columns depending on viewport width.\n- Visual polish: Hover ring effect, subtle shadow, and staggered fade-up animation.\n- Accessibility: Alt text generated from the localized name; fallback avatar when no image is present.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L235)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L185-L249)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe component integrates with the global language provider and Tailwind/CSS animations to deliver a polished, multilingual experience.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Provider as \"LanguageProvider\"\n  participant Component as \"SpeakersSection\"\n  participant Grid as \"Grid Container\"\n  participant Card as \"Speaker Card\"\n  participant CSS as \"index.css\"\n\n  Provider-\u003e\u003eComponent: \"t(language)\"\n  Component-\u003e\u003eComponent: \"getName(speaker)\"\n  Component-\u003e\u003eComponent: \"getRole(speaker)\"\n  Component-\u003e\u003eGrid: \"Render grid with Tailwind classes\"\n  Grid-\u003e\u003eCard: \"Render each speaker\"\n  Card-\u003e\u003eCSS: \"Apply animate-fade-up + hover effects\"\n  Card--\u003e\u003eComponent: \"Alt text from getName(speaker)\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L235)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L185-L249)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Data Model and Internationalization\n- Speaker interface defines fields for Arabic, English, and Turkish names and roles, plus an optional image URL.\n- getName and getRole select the appropriate field based on the current language.\n- Translations for the section title and subtitle are provided under the speakers namespace.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class Speaker {\n    +number id\n    +string name\n    +string nameEn\n    +string nameTr\n    +string role\n    +string roleEn\n    +string roleTr\n    +string image?\n  }\n\n  class SpeakersSection {\n    +getName(speaker) string\n    +getRole(speaker) string\n  }\n\n  class LanguageContext {\n    +language\n    +t(key) string\n  }\n\n  SpeakersSection --\u003e Speaker : \"maps over\"\n  SpeakersSection --\u003e LanguageContext : \"uses t(language)\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L18-L27)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L174-L184)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L18-L27)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L174-L184)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L96)\n\n### Responsive Grid Layout\n- The grid uses Tailwind’s responsive column classes to adapt from 1 to 4 columns:\n  - 1 column on small screens\n  - 2 columns from the small breakpoint\n  - 3 columns from the large breakpoint\n  - 4 columns from the extra-large breakpoint\n- Gap spacing is standardized for visual rhythm.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Render Grid\"]) --\u003e Small[\"Small screen\u003cbr/\u003e1 column\"]\n  Small --\u003e Medium[\"Medium+\u003cbr/\u003e2 columns\"]\n  Medium --\u003e Large[\"Large+\u003cbr/\u003e3 columns\"]\n  Large --\u003e XL[\"Extra-large+\u003cbr/\u003e4 columns\"]\n  XL --\u003e End([\"Cards arranged\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L199-L206)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L199-L206)\n\n### Card Design and Interactions\n- Card container:\n  - Rounded corners, border, and subtle background\n  - Hover effects: border color change and increased shadow\n- Circular image container:\n  - Fixed size with rounded-full and overflow-hidden\n  - Ring effect via ring-2 with primary color\n  - Hover ring intensifies on group hover\n- Image fallback:\n  - When no image is present, a colored background with a person icon is shown\n- Typography:\n  - Name is bold and centered\n  - Role is smaller, muted, and centered with relaxed line height\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  CardStart([\"Card Render\"]) --\u003e ImageCheck{\"Has image?\"}\n  ImageCheck -- \"Yes\" --\u003e ImgNode[\"Render img\u003cbr/\u003ealt from getName()\"]\n  ImageCheck -- \"No\" --\u003e Fallback[\"Render fallback avatar\u003cbr/\u003ewith person icon\"]\n  ImgNode --\u003e TextNodes[\"Render name + role\"]\n  Fallback --\u003e TextNodes\n  TextNodes --\u003e End([\"Card ready\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L207-L229)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L207-L229)\n\n### Animations and Staggered Delays\n- Fade-up animation:\n  - Defined via keyframes and applied with a utility class\n  - Cards animate upward with decreasing opacity and translate Y\n- Staggered delays:\n  - Each card receives a style-based animation delay proportional to its index\n  - This creates a cascading entrance effect\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant Grid as \"Grid\"\n  participant Card as \"Card\"\n  Grid-\u003e\u003eCard: \"Render with index\"\n  Card-\u003e\u003eCard: \"Set animationDelay = index * 50ms\"\n  Card-\u003e\u003eCard: \"Apply animate-fade-up\"\n  Note over Card: \"Cards appear in sequence\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L204-L206)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L190-L200)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L231-L233)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L204-L206)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L190-L200)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L231-L233)\n\n### Accessibility Features\n- Alt text:\n  - The image element’s alt attribute is set to the localized speaker name via getName(speaker)\n- Semantic structure:\n  - Headings and paragraphs are used appropriately around the grid\n- Color contrast:\n  - Hover ring and text colors rely on theme tokens; ensure sufficient contrast against backgrounds\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L210-L214)\n\n### Internationalization Challenges and Best Practices\n- Name rendering:\n  - The component expects name fields in Arabic, English, and Turkish\n  - If a translation is missing for a key, the LanguageContext falls back to the key itself\n- Role rendering:\n  - Roles are similarly localized; keep entries aligned across languages\n- Adding new languages:\n  - Extend the LanguageContext translation map and update the getName/getRole logic if needed\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L272-L274)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L174-L184)\n\n### Speaker Data Structure Example\nBelow is the structure used by the component. Add new speakers by extending the speakers array with the same fields.\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n  SPEAKER {\n    number id PK\n    string name\n    string nameEn\n    string nameTr\n    string role\n    string roleEn\n    string roleTr\n    string image\n  }\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L18-L27)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L29-L169)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Internal dependencies:\n  - LanguageContext: Provides t and language state\n  - index.css: Provides animations and delay utilities\n- External assets:\n  - Speaker images are imported locally and assigned to the image property\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e SS[\"SpeakersSection.tsx\"]\n  CSS[\"index.css\"] --\u003e SS\n  IMG[\"Speaker Images\"] --\u003e SS\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L17)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L231-L249)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L1-L17)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L231-L249)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Image optimization:\n  - Prefer modern formats (WebP) and appropriate resolutions for the card size\n  - Compress images to reduce payload while maintaining quality\n- Lazy loading:\n  - Consider using native loading=\"lazy\" on img elements for off-screen cards\n  - Alternatively, implement intersection observer-based lazy loading for large lists\n- Asset bundling:\n  - Keep images colocated and named consistently to simplify maintenance\n- Animation performance:\n  - The fade-up animation uses transform and opacity—these are GPU-friendly\n  - Avoid heavy filters or excessive repaints inside the card\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Missing alt text:\n  - Ensure getName returns a non-empty string; otherwise, the alt attribute will be empty\n- No image displayed:\n  - Verify the image property is set; otherwise, the fallback avatar will show\n- Translation fallback:\n  - If a translation key is missing, the component falls back to the key itself; confirm keys exist in the LanguageContext\n- Layout issues:\n  - Confirm Tailwind breakpoints are applied as intended; adjust grid classes if needed\n- Hover ring not visible:\n  - Ensure the ring color tokens are available in your theme and that the group hover context is active\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L210-L219)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L272-L274)\n\n## Conclusion\nSpeakersSection delivers a clean, responsive, and accessible showcase of event participants. By leveraging a typed data model, helper functions for localization, and Tailwind-driven animations, it provides a consistent experience across languages and devices. Extending the component involves adding new speakers to the array and ensuring translations and images are available.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-8dd7245f-7a40-4556-a135-052d6cfffbe8","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":41058,"completion_tokens":3176,"total_tokens":44234,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
