Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate detailed documentation for the ShadCN UI component library implementation in the project. These components are built on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. For each component, document its props, events, and accessibility features. Explain how they integrate with the application's theme and RTL layout system. Provide usage examples from the actual codebase, such as how Button, Card, and Dialog are used in section components. Detail the utility function 'cn' from lib/utils.ts used for conditional class composition. Address common issues like focus management, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility. Include performance considerations such as component bundling and tree-shaking via components.json. Highlight customization patterns through Tailwind variants and theme extensions.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nUI Component Library\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

The components are built on Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS, following modern React patterns for accessibility, theming, and performance. The library includes foundational components such as Button, Card, Dialog, Form, and Input, which are used throughout the application's section components to create a consistent user interface.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n\n## Core Components\n\nThe UI component library consists of reusable, accessible components built on top of Radix UI primitives. These components abstract complex accessibility patterns while providing styling through Tailwind CSS. Key components include Button, Card, Dialog, Form, Input, Select, Checkbox, Textarea, Label, and Badge.\n\nEach component is implemented as a React forwardRef component, ensuring proper ref forwarding for accessibility and integration purposes. The components leverage the `cn` utility function for conditional class composition and integrate with the application's theme system through CSS variables.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n    subgraph \"UI Components\"\n        Button[\"Button Component\"]\n        Card[\"Card Component\"]\n        Dialog[\"Dialog Component\"]\n        Form[\"Form Component\"]\n        Input[\"Input Component\"]\n        Select[\"Select Component\"]\n        Checkbox[\"Checkbox Component\"]\n    end\n    \n    subgraph \"Utilities\"\n        Utils[\"utils.ts\"]\n        Tailwind[\"Tailwind CSS\"]\n        Radix[\"Radix UI Primitives\"]\n    end\n    \n    Button --\u003e Utils\n    Card --\u003e Utils\n    Dialog --\u003e Utils\n    Form --\u003e Utils\n    Input --\u003e Utils\n    Select --\u003e Utils\n    Checkbox --\u003e Utils\n    Utils --\u003e Tailwind\n    Button --\u003e Radix\n    Dialog --\u003e Radix\n    Select --\u003e Radix\n    Checkbox --\u003e Radix\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L1-L48)\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n\n## Component Props and Accessibility\n\n### Button Component\nThe Button component supports various props for customization and accessibility:\n- **variant**: Controls visual style (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost, link)\n- **size**: Controls dimensions (default, sm, lg, icon)\n- **asChild**: When true, renders as a Slot component for composing with other elements\n- **className**: Additional Tailwind classes for custom styling\n\nThe component implements proper focus management with visible focus rings and ensures keyboard navigation support. It uses the `buttonVariants` utility from class-variance-authority to manage variant styles.\n\n### Card Component\nThe Card component is composed of multiple sub-components:\n- **Card**: Main container with border, background, and shadow\n- **CardHeader**: Top section with spacing\n- **CardTitle**: Heading with larger font size and tracking\n- **CardDescription**: Subtitle with muted text color\n- **CardContent**: Main content area with padding\n- **CardFooter**: Bottom section for actions\n\nEach sub-component maintains proper semantic HTML structure and accessibility attributes.\n\n### Dialog Component\nThe Dialog component implements a fully accessible modal pattern:\n- **Dialog**: Root component managing open/closed state\n- **DialogTrigger**: Button that opens the dialog\n- **DialogContent**: Modal panel with proper positioning and animations\n- **DialogOverlay**: Backdrop that traps focus and closes on click\n- **DialogTitle**: Accessible name for the dialog\n- **DialogDescription**: Accessible description for screen readers\n\nThe implementation follows WAI-ARIA authoring practices for dialogs, including focus trapping, proper role attributes, and screen reader announcements.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L33-L47)\n- [card.tsx](file://src/components/ui/card.tsx#L5-L43)\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L7-L95)\n\n## Theming and RTL Integration\n\nThe component library integrates with the application's theme system through CSS variables defined in the Tailwind configuration. The `tailwind.config.ts` file defines a comprehensive theme system using HSL color variables that can be easily customized.\n\nTheme variables include:\n- **Semantic colors**: border, input, ring, background, foreground, primary, secondary, destructive, muted, accent, popover, card\n- **Syrian-specific colors**: syrian-red, syrian-green, syrian-black, gold, cream\n- **Sidebar-specific colors**: sidebar-background, sidebar-foreground, sidebar-primary, etc.\n- **Border radius**: Defined as CSS variables for consistent rounded corners\n- **Animation keyframes**: For accordion open/close transitions\n\nThe theme system supports both light and dark modes through the `darkMode: [\"class\"]` configuration, which adds a `dark` class to the root element when dark mode is active.\n\nFor RTL (right-to-left) layout support, the components use semantic class names and flexible layout utilities from Tailwind CSS. The `components.json` configuration file defines aliases that make it easier to import components regardless of their physical location in the directory structure.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class ThemeVariables {\n        +--border: hsl(var(--border))\n        +--input: hsl(var(--input))\n        +--ring: hsl(var(--ring))\n        +--background: hsl(var(--background))\n        +--foreground: hsl(var(--foreground))\n        +--primary: hsl(var(--primary))\n        +--syrian-red: hsl(var(--syrian-red))\n        +--syrian-green: hsl(var(--syrian-green))\n        +--gold: hsl(var(--gold))\n        +--radius: 0.5rem\n    }\n    \n    class TailwindConfig {\n        +darkMode: [\"class\"]\n        +content: string[]\n        +theme: object\n        +plugins: function[]\n    }\n    \n    class ComponentsJson {\n        +style: \"default\"\n        +tsx: true\n        +tailwind: object\n        +aliases: object\n    }\n    \n    TailwindConfig --\u003e ThemeVariables : \"defines\"\n    ComponentsJson --\u003e TailwindConfig : \"references\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n\n## Utility Functions\n\n### cn Utility Function\nThe `cn` function in `utils.ts` is a crucial utility for conditional class composition. It combines `clsx` for conditional class evaluation and `tailwind-merge` for resolving Tailwind class conflicts.\n\n```typescript\nimport { clsx, type ClassValue } from \"clsx\";\nimport { twMerge } from \"tailwind-merge\";\n\nexport function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {\n  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));\n}\n```\n\nThis utility allows developers to:\n- Combine static and dynamic classes safely\n- Resolve conflicting Tailwind classes (e.g., `text-red-500` vs `text-green-500`)\n- Conditionally apply classes based on props or state\n- Maintain clean, readable JSX without complex template literals\n\nThe function is imported throughout the component library using the `@/lib/utils` alias defined in `components.json`.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n## Usage Examples\n\n### Button Usage in Section Components\nWhile the section components don't directly use the Button component, the pattern is consistent with how other UI components are used. The HeroSection uses a custom CTA button with similar styling principles:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[\"CTA Button in HeroSection\"] --\u003e B[\"Uses gradient-gold class\"]\n    B --\u003e C[\"Includes hover:scale-105 for interaction feedback\"]\n    C --\u003e D[\"Uses glow-gold for visual effect\"]\n    D --\u003e E[\"Semantic HTML with anchor tag\"]\n```\n\n### Card Usage Patterns\nThe DetailsSection component implements card-like elements with similar design principles to the Card component:\n\n- Uses `backdrop-blur-sm` for glassmorphism effect\n- Applies `hover:bg-primary-foreground/20` for hover states\n- Implements `transition-all` for smooth animations\n- Uses semantic structure with icon, title, and content\n\n### Form Component Integration\nThe Form component provides a comprehensive solution for form management using react-hook-form:\n\n- **Form**: Wrapper component that provides form context\n- **FormField**: Connects form fields with react-hook-form controller\n- **FormItem**: Groups form elements with proper spacing\n- **FormLabel**: Accessible label with error state handling\n- **FormControl**: Applies proper ARIA attributes\n- **FormDescription**: Optional descriptive text\n- **FormMessage**: Displays error messages with proper semantics\n\nThe implementation ensures proper accessibility by:\n- Connecting labels with inputs via generated IDs\n- Applying `aria-invalid` when there are errors\n- Providing `aria-describedby` for additional context\n- Managing focus states appropriately\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L83-L91)\n- [DetailsSection.tsx](file://src/components/DetailsSection.tsx#L25-L58)\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L1-L130)\n\n## Performance and Bundling\n\nThe component library is optimized for performance through several mechanisms:\n\n### Tree-Shaking\nThe `components.json` configuration enables proper tree-shaking by:\n- Defining explicit import aliases\n- Using ES module syntax with named exports\n- Avoiding default exports that can hinder tree-shaking\n- Structuring components as separate files for granular imports\n\n### Component Bundling\nComponents are designed to be imported individually, ensuring that only used components are included in the final bundle. The alias system (`@/components/ui`) makes imports clean and consistent while allowing bundlers to statically analyze dependencies.\n\n### Render Performance\nComponents are optimized for render performance by:\n- Using `React.memo` where appropriate (implied by ShadCN patterns)\n- Minimizing re-renders through proper prop handling\n- Using efficient class composition with `cn`\n- Leveraging Tailwind's JIT compiler for optimal CSS output\n\nThe configuration in `components.json` specifies `\"rsc\": false` indicating these are not React Server Components, making them suitable for client-side rendering with optimal hydration patterns.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [components.json](file://components.json#L1-L21)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Customization Patterns\n\n### Tailwind Variants\nComponents use `class-variance-authority` (CVA) to define variant styles in a type-safe manner. The Button component demonstrates this pattern:\n\n```typescript\nconst buttonVariants = cva(\n  \"inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 whitespace-nowrap rounded-md text-sm font-medium...\",\n  {\n    variants: {\n      variant: {\n        default: \"bg-primary text-primary-foreground hover:bg-primary/90\",\n        destructive: \"bg-destructive text-destructive-foreground hover:bg-destructive/90\",\n        // ... other variants\n      },\n      size: {\n        default: \"h-10 px-4 py-2\",\n        sm: \"h-9 rounded-md px-3\",\n        // ... other sizes\n      },\n    },\n    defaultVariants: {\n      variant: \"default\",\n      size: \"default\",\n    },\n  },\n);\n```\n\nThis approach provides:\n- Type safety for variant props\n- Consistent styling across components\n- Easy theme customization\n- Automatic TypeScript IntelliSense\n\n### Theme Extensions\nThe theme system can be extended by adding new CSS variables in the `tailwind.config.ts` file. The Syrian-specific colors (red, green, black) and gold accent demonstrate this customization pattern:\n\n```typescript\ntheme: {\n  extend: {\n    colors: {\n      syrian: {\n        red: \"hsl(var(--syrian-red))\",\n        green: \"hsl(var(--syrian-green))\",\n        black: \"hsl(var(--syrian-black))\",\n      },\n      gold: {\n        DEFAULT: \"hsl(var(--gold))\",\n        light: \"hsl(var(--gold-light))\",\n      },\n      cream: \"hsl(var(--cream))\",\n    },\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThese custom colors can then be used throughout the application with standard Tailwind syntax (e.g., `text-syrian-red`, `bg-gold`).\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L7-L31)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L20-L63)\n\n## Accessibility Features\n\nThe component library prioritizes accessibility through several key patterns:\n\n### Focus Management\n- All interactive elements have visible focus indicators\n- Focus is trapped within dialogs when open\n- Proper focus restoration when dialogs close\n- Skip links could be easily implemented using the same patterns\n\n### Keyboard Navigation\n- Full keyboard operability for all components\n- Logical tab order maintained\n- Escape key closes dialogs and dropdowns\n- Arrow keys navigate through select options\n\n### Screen Reader Compatibility\n- Proper ARIA roles and attributes applied\n- Semantic HTML structure with appropriate heading levels\n- Dynamic content updates announced to screen readers\n- Error messages programmatically associated with controls\n\n### Color Contrast\n- Sufficient contrast ratios for text and interactive elements\n- Dark mode support with adjusted color values\n- Custom colors designed with accessibility in mind\n\n### Reduced Motion\n- Animations are subtle and can be disabled via user preferences\n- CSS transitions are used rather than jarring animations\n- The `data-[state=open]` attributes allow for conditional animations\n\nThe implementation follows WCAG 2.1 guidelines and WAI-ARIA best practices, ensuring the interface is usable by people with various disabilities.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [button.tsx](file://src/components/ui/button.tsx#L8-L9)\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L15-L51)\n- [form.tsx](file://src/components/ui/form.tsx#L75-L127)\n- [checkbox.tsx](file://src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx#L7-L23)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe ShadCN UI component library implementation in this project demonstrates a robust, accessible, and maintainable approach to building React components. By leveraging Radix UI primitives for accessibility and behavior, Tailwind CSS for styling, and thoughtful utility functions like `cn`, the library provides a solid foundation for the application's user interface.\n\nKey strengths include:\n- Consistent theming through CSS variables\n- Proper accessibility implementation\n- Efficient performance characteristics\n- Clear customization patterns\n- Well-organized code structure\n\nThe components are effectively used throughout the application's section components, providing a cohesive user experience while allowing for necessary customization to meet the specific needs of the Syrian community event website.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-ffbe3205-edd2-492a-9493-c012e9e230de","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":22632,"completion_tokens":3746,"total_tokens":26378,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
