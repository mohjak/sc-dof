Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for navigation-related components including NavigationMenu, Sidebar, Tabs, and Breadcrumb.

The navigation system is designed to provide an intuitive user experience across different devices and languages, with special consideration for Arabic language support and RTL (right-to-left) layouts. The components covered include NavigationMenu, Sidebar, Tabs, and Breadcrumb, each serving specific roles in the site's information architecture and user navigation.\n\n## Core Navigation Components\n\nThe application implements a comprehensive navigation system using four primary components that work together to create a cohesive user experience. These components are built using Radix UI primitives for accessibility and enhanced with Tailwind CSS for styling. The NavigationMenu serves as the primary navigation in the navbar, the Sidebar provides responsive off-canvas navigation, Tabs enable section switching within pages, and Breadcrumb maintains hierarchy tracking for complex content structures.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [navigation-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx)\n- [sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx)\n- [tabs.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tabs.tsx)\n- [breadcrumb.tsx](file://src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx)\n\n## NavigationMenu Implementation\n\nThe NavigationMenu component is implemented as a sophisticated dropdown menu system that integrates seamlessly with the application's navbar. Built on Radix UI's NavigationMenu primitive, it provides accessible navigation with proper ARIA roles and keyboard navigation support. The component supports nested menu structures with smooth animations for content entry and exit, using data attributes to control animation states.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class NavigationMenu {\n        +Root: NavigationMenuPrimitive.Root\n        +List: NavigationMenuPrimitive.List\n        +Item: NavigationMenuPrimitive.Item\n        +Trigger: NavigationMenuPrimitive.Trigger\n        +Content: NavigationMenuPrimitive.Content\n        +Link: NavigationMenuPrimitive.Link\n        +Viewport: NavigationMenuPrimitive.Viewport\n    }\n    \n    NavigationMenu --\u003e NavigationMenuPrimitive : \"uses\"\n    NavigationMenu --\u003e cva : \"uses for styling\"\n    NavigationMenu --\u003e cn : \"uses for class merging\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [navigation-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [navigation-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx)\n\n## Sidebar Functionality\n\nThe Sidebar component implements a responsive, collapsible navigation panel that adapts to different screen sizes. It provides both desktop and mobile navigation patterns, with a floating sidebar on larger screens and an off-canvas drawer on mobile devices. The component maintains its state across sessions using cookies and supports keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+B) for toggling visibility. The implementation includes features like collapsible icons, tooltips for collapsed states, and resizable panels.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User\n    participant SidebarProvider\n    participant Sidebar\n    participant useIsMobile\n    \n    User-\u003e\u003eSidebarProvider: Initialize with defaultOpen\n    SidebarProvider-\u003e\u003euseIsMobile: Check screen size\n    useIsMobile--\u003e\u003eSidebarProvider: Return isMobile boolean\n    SidebarProvider-\u003e\u003eSidebar: Render based on state and device\n    alt Mobile device\n        Sidebar-\u003e\u003eSheet: Render as off-canvas drawer\n        Sheet--\u003e\u003eUser: Display mobile navigation\n    else Desktop device\n        Sidebar-\u003e\u003eSidebar: Render as collapsible panel\n        Sidebar--\u003e\u003eUser: Display desktop navigation\n    end\n    User-\u003e\u003eSidebar: Press Ctrl+B\n    Sidebar-\u003e\u003eSidebarProvider: Toggle sidebar state\n    SidebarProvider-\u003e\u003edocument.cookie: Update sidebar state\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx)\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx)\n\n## Tabs Component\n\nThe Tabs component provides a clean interface for switching between different sections of content within a page. Built on Radix UI's Tabs primitive, it ensures proper accessibility with ARIA tablist roles and keyboard navigation support. The implementation includes visual indicators for the active tab, with smooth transitions between states. The component is styled to match the application's design system, with hover effects and focus indicators that enhance usability.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Tabs {\n        +Root: TabsPrimitive.Root\n        +List: TabsPrimitive.List\n        +Trigger: TabsPrimitive.Trigger\n        +Content: TabsPrimitive.Content\n    }\n    \n    Tabs --\u003e TabsPrimitive : \"uses\"\n    Tabs --\u003e cn : \"uses for class merging\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [tabs.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tabs.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tabs.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tabs.tsx)\n\n## Breadcrumb Component\n\nThe Breadcrumb component implements a hierarchical navigation aid that helps users understand their location within the site's structure. It follows accessibility best practices with proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML. The component supports custom separators and can be easily extended to include ellipsis for long navigation paths. The implementation uses semantic elements like nav, ol, and li to maintain proper document structure.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Breadcrumb {\n        +nav: aria-label=\"breadcrumb\"\n        +List: ol element\n        +Item: li element\n        +Link: a element\n        +Page: span element\n        +Separator: li element\n        +Ellipsis: span element\n    }\n    \n    Breadcrumb --\u003e Slot : \"uses for asChild\"\n    Breadcrumb --\u003e cn : \"uses for class merging\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [breadcrumb.tsx](file://src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [breadcrumb.tsx](file://src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx)\n\n## Integration with React Router\n\nThe navigation components are integrated with React Router through a custom NavLink component that wraps the router's NavLink. This implementation allows for style customization based on navigation state (active, pending) while maintaining all the functionality of React Router. The NavLink component uses the cn utility to merge class names and apply different styles based on whether a link is active, enabling visual feedback for the current page.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant NavLink\n    participant RouterNavLink\n    participant NavigationMenuLink\n    participant User\n    \n    User-\u003e\u003eNavLink: Click on navigation link\n    NavLink-\u003e\u003eRouterNavLink: Pass to, className, and other props\n    RouterNavLink-\u003e\u003eRouterNavLink: Determine isActive and isPending\n    RouterNavLink-\u003e\u003eNavLink: Return state to className function\n    NavLink-\u003e\u003ecn: Merge base className with active/pending classes\n    cn--\u003e\u003eNavLink: Return final className\n    NavLink--\u003e\u003eUser: Render link with appropriate styling\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx)\n\n## Accessibility Features\n\nThe navigation components implement comprehensive accessibility features to ensure usability for all users. Keyboard navigation is fully supported across all components, with proper focus management and logical tab order. ARIA roles are correctly applied: menu roles for NavigationMenu, tablist roles for Tabs, and appropriate landmark roles for navigation regions. Focus indicators are visible and meet contrast requirements, and screen reader announcements are implemented through aria-labels and aria-current attributes.\n\nThe components also support keyboard shortcuts for enhanced navigation efficiency. The Sidebar can be toggled with Ctrl+B, and all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard tabbing. Navigation menus support arrow key navigation, and tabs can be switched using left/right arrow keys. These features ensure that users who rely on keyboard navigation can efficiently interact with all navigation elements.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [navigation-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx)\n- [sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx)\n- [tabs.tsx](file://src/components/ui/tabs.tsx)\n- [breadcrumb.tsx](file://src/components/ui/breadcrumb.tsx)\n\n## RTL Layout Support\n\nThe application provides robust RTL (right-to-left) layout support, particularly important for Arabic language users. The LanguageContext manages the current language and directionality, with isRTL flag set to true when the language is Arabic. This context is consumed by the App component, which applies the appropriate dir attribute to the root element and adjusts the font family accordingly.\n\nThe navigation components automatically adapt to RTL layouts, with directional CSS variables and Tailwind classes that flip the layout. The Sidebar component, for example, adjusts its positioning and animation directions based on the text direction. The NavigationMenu's dropdown positioning and animations are also reversed in RTL mode to maintain intuitive user experience.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    Start([Application Start]) --\u003e LanguageProvider[\"LanguageProvider initializes with default language 'ar'\"]\n    LanguageProvider --\u003e LanguageContext[\"Creates LanguageContext with language, setLanguage, t, isRTL\"]\n    LanguageContext --\u003e App[\"App consumes useLanguage hook\"]\n    App --\u003e DirectionCheck{\"isRTL = true?\"}\n    DirectionCheck --\u003e|Yes| ApplyRTL[\"Apply dir='rtl' and Koufiya font\"]\n    DirectionCheck --\u003e|No| ApplyLTR[\"Apply dir='ltr' and Roboto font\"]\n    ApplyRTL --\u003e Navbar[\"Navbar renders with RTL layout\"]\n    ApplyLTR --\u003e Navbar\n    Navbar --\u003e NavigationMenu[\"NavigationMenu adapts to direction\"]\n    NavigationMenu --\u003e End([Navigation ready])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx)\n\n## Customization and Theming\n\nThe navigation components are highly customizable through Tailwind CSS variants and theme-aware design. The components use the cn utility function to merge class names, allowing for easy customization while preserving base functionality. The Sidebar component, for example, supports different variants (sidebar, floating, inset) and collapsible modes (offcanvas, icon, none), enabling different layout patterns for various use cases.\n\nTheme-aware icons from Lucide React are used throughout the navigation components, ensuring visual consistency and proper color application based on the current theme. The components also support customization through props like asChild, which allows wrapping arbitrary content while maintaining navigation semantics and styling.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [navigation-menu.tsx](file://src/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx)\n- [sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx)\n- [lib/utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts)\n\n## Common Issues and Troubleshooting\n\nSeveral common issues may arise when implementing and using the navigation components. One potential issue is touch swipe conflicts on mobile devices, where swipe gestures might interfere with sidebar opening/closing. This can be addressed by implementing proper touch event handling and gesture recognition.\n\nTab activation problems can occur when dynamic content loading affects the tab state. Ensuring proper key management and state synchronization between the UI and React Router can resolve these issues. For RTL layout flipping, developers should verify that all directional CSS properties are properly inverted and that animations maintain their intended behavior.\n\nPerformance issues may arise with complex navigation structures. Implementing lazy loading for navigation content and optimizing re-renders with React.memo can help maintain smooth performance. Additionally, ensuring proper cleanup of event listeners (as seen in the Sidebar's keyboard shortcut implementation) prevents memory leaks.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx)\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe navigation components in the Syrian Community Day of Freedom application provide a robust, accessible, and internationalized navigation system. By leveraging Radix UI primitives, React Router integration, and Tailwind CSS customization, the components deliver a seamless user experience across devices and languages. The implementation demonstrates best practices in accessibility, responsive design, and internationalization, particularly with comprehensive RTL support for Arabic language users. These components form the backbone of the application's user interface, enabling intuitive navigation and content discovery.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-0c65917e-9910-42c9-8a51-e2f7102f57ee","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":30636,"completion_tokens":2861,"total_tokens":33497,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
