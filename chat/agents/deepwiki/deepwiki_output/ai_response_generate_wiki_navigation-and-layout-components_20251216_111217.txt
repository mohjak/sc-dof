Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for navigation and layout utility components that enhance user experience. Explain how Navbar provides top-level navigation with responsive behavior on mobile devices, integrating NavLink for active state handling and LanguageSwitcher for multilingual support. Describe how ScrollToTop enables smooth scrolling to the top of the page, particularly useful on long-form event sites. Detail the implementation of NavLink with React Router's useMatch hook for active link styling. Illustrate how LanguageSwitcher interacts with LanguageContext to update the application language and trigger RTL layout changes. Include examples of event-driven navigation patterns and scroll position management. Address common issues such as mobile menu toggle bugs, incorrect active link states, and scroll restoration after language changes. Provide optimization tips for rendering performance and accessibility compliance.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nNavigation and Layout Components\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers:\n- Navbar: top-level navigation with responsive behavior, mobile menu toggle, and scroll-aware styling.\n- NavLink: active-state handling compatible with React Router’s NavLink.\n- LanguageSwitcher: multilingual support and RTL layout updates via LanguageContext.\n- ScrollToTop: smooth scrolling to the top of the page for long-form content.\nIt also provides examples of event-driven navigation patterns, scroll position management, common issues, and optimization tips for performance and accessibility.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe navigation and layout utilities are organized under src/components and integrated into the application via the root App wrapper and the Index page.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Root\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\"]\n    Provider[\"LanguageProvider\"]\n    Router[\"BrowserRouter\"]\n    Routes[\"Routes '/' and '*'\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Pages\"\n    Index[\"Index.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Layout and Navigation\"\n    Navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n    Scroll[\"ScrollToTop.tsx\"]\n    LangSwitch[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n    NavLinkComp[\"NavLink.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  App --\u003e Provider\n  Provider --\u003e AppContent[\"AppContent\"]\n  AppContent --\u003e Router\n  Router --\u003e Routes\n  Routes --\u003e Index\n  Index --\u003e Navbar\n  Index --\u003e Scroll\n  Navbar --\u003e LangSwitch\n  Navbar --\u003e NavLinkComp\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L13-L29)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L38-L119)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L41)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L11-L27)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L13-L29)\n\n## Core Components\n- Navbar: Provides a sticky, scroll-aware navigation bar with desktop and mobile views, a logo link, internal anchor links, and a LanguageSwitcher. It toggles a mobile menu and applies RTL direction when appropriate.\n- NavLink: A wrapper around React Router’s NavLink that supports custom active/pending class names and forwards refs.\n- LanguageSwitcher: Allows switching languages and reflects the current selection with distinct styling. It triggers RTL layout changes via LanguageContext.\n- ScrollToTop: Shows a floating button when scrolled down far enough and smoothly scrolls to the top on click.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L38-L119)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L11-L27)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L41)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe application initializes language and routing providers at the root. The Index page composes Navbar and ScrollToTop alongside content sections. Navbar integrates LanguageSwitcher and uses internal anchor links to navigate to sections. LanguageSwitcher updates the language in LanguageContext, which controls translation keys and RTL direction at the app root.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Navbar as \"Navbar.tsx\"\n  participant Lang as \"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"\n  participant Ctx as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant App as \"App.tsx\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eLang: Click language button\n  Lang-\u003e\u003eCtx: setLanguage(code)\n  Ctx--\u003e\u003eApp: language changed\n  App--\u003e\u003eApp: dir='rtl'/'ltr' based on isRTL\n  App--\u003e\u003eNavbar: re-render with new language and isRTL\n  Navbar--\u003e\u003eUser: Updated labels and layout direction\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L38-L119)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Navbar\nResponsibilities:\n- Renders desktop and mobile navigation lists.\n- Smooth-scrolls to sections using anchor links.\n- Toggles mobile menu visibility.\n- Applies scroll-aware styling and RTL direction.\n- Integrates LanguageSwitcher in both desktop and mobile layouts.\n\nKey behaviors:\n- Uses internal anchor links to jump to sections with smooth scrolling.\n- Maintains a local state for mobile menu open/close.\n- Listens to scroll events to adjust navbar appearance.\n- Passes RTL direction to the nav container.\n\nAccessibility and UX:\n- Uses aria-label for the mobile menu toggle.\n- Uses anchor links for navigation, which are keyboard accessible.\n\nResponsive behavior:\n- Desktop: horizontal list of links.\n- Mobile: stacked list with LanguageSwitcher inside.\n\nIntegration points:\n- Links are generated from translation keys via useLanguage.\n- Uses LanguageContext for isRTL to set dir on the nav element.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L38-L119)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n\n### NavLink\nPurpose:\n- Provide a compatible wrapper around React Router’s NavLink with support for custom active and pending class names.\n- Forward refs for imperative access if needed.\n\nImplementation highlights:\n- Accepts className, activeClassName, pendingClassName, and forwards props to Router NavLink.\n- Uses cn from utils to merge Tailwind classes safely.\n\nCommon use cases:\n- Replace standard anchor tags with router-aware links while preserving custom active/pending styles.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L11-L27)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n\n### LanguageSwitcher\nCapabilities:\n- Presents a set of language options with distinct styling for the selected language.\n- Updates the current language via LanguageContext.setLanguage.\n- Supports two variants: floating and navbar.\n\nBehavior:\n- Uses flags or a localized image for non-Arabic languages.\n- Adjusts font family at the app root based on language selection.\n\nRTL implications:\n- LanguageContext.isRTL determines whether the app is rendered right-to-left.\n- Navbar sets dir on the nav element based on isRTL.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\n### ScrollToTop\nFunctionality:\n- Shows a floating button when the user scrolls down past a threshold.\n- Smoothly scrolls to the top of the page on click.\n- Hides the button when not needed.\n\nAccessibility:\n- Provides an aria-label for screen readers.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n### Event-Driven Navigation Patterns and Scroll Position Management\nPatterns:\n- Internal anchor navigation: Navbar uses anchor links to sections (e.g., #hero, #why, #agenda). These rely on section ids present in the page.\n- Smooth scrolling: Navbar’s scrollToSection uses scrollIntoView with smooth behavior.\n- Scroll awareness: Navbar adjusts styling based on scroll position.\n\nScroll position management:\n- On language change, the app does not automatically restore scroll position. If needed, consider adding a scroll restoration strategy (e.g., persisting scroll positions or restoring after language updates).\n\nExample references:\n- Anchor targets are defined by section ids in the Index page composition.\n- Navbar anchors target these ids for navigation.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L29-L36)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L13-L29)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L10-L12)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nThe components depend on shared utilities and contexts:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"] --\u003e LangSwitch[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  Navbar --\u003e Ctx[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  Navbar --\u003e Utils[\"utils.ts\"]\n  App[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e Ctx\n  Index[\"Index.tsx\"] --\u003e Navbar\n  Index --\u003e Scroll[\"ScrollToTop.tsx\"]\n  NavLinkComp[\"NavLink.tsx\"] --\u003e Utils\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L38-L119)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L13-L29)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L11-L27)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L38-L119)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L1-L7)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L13-L29)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L11-L27)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Avoid unnecessary re-renders:\n  - Keep Navbar state minimal and scoped to UI-only concerns (e.g., mobile menu and scroll awareness).\n  - Memoize navigation link arrays if they become dynamic or expensive to compute.\n- Event listeners:\n  - Both Navbar and ScrollToTop attach scroll listeners. Ensure cleanup occurs on unmount (already handled).\n- Rendering cost:\n  - LanguageSwitcher renders a small fixed list; keep it lightweight.\n  - NavLink is a thin wrapper; ensure className merging via cn is efficient.\n- Accessibility:\n  - Use aria-labels and roles where applicable (already present).\n  - Prefer anchor links for navigation to improve keyboard and assistive technology support.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\nCommon issues and resolutions:\n\n- Mobile menu toggle bugs\n  - Symptom: Menu does not open or close reliably.\n  - Checks:\n    - Verify the toggle state is controlled by the button’s onClick handler.\n    - Confirm the mobile menu block is conditionally rendered based on the state.\n  - Related code paths:\n    - Toggle button and state: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L84-L91)\n    - Conditional render of mobile menu: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L95-L116)\n\n- Incorrect active link states\n  - Symptom: Active class not applied to current route.\n  - Checks:\n    - Ensure the component using NavLink is mounted within a Router.\n    - Verify activeClassName and pendingClassName are passed correctly.\n  - Related code paths:\n    - NavLink wrapper: [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L11-L27)\n\n- Scroll restoration after language changes\n  - Symptom: Page jumps or loses scroll position after language switch.\n  - Checks:\n    - The app does not implement explicit scroll restoration on language change.\n    - Consider persisting scroll positions or triggering a scroll restoration after language updates.\n  - Related code paths:\n    - LanguageContext provider and consumers: [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n    - App root applying direction and font class: [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\n- RTL layout not updating\n  - Symptom: Text direction remains LTR after switching to Arabic.\n  - Checks:\n    - Ensure the app root receives isRTL from LanguageContext and applies dir accordingly.\n    - Confirm Navbar also respects isRTL for its container.\n  - Related code paths:\n    - App root dir binding: [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n    - Navbar dir binding: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L40-L46)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L84-L116)\n- [NavLink.tsx](file://src/components/NavLink.tsx#L11-L27)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe navigation and layout utilities provide a cohesive, accessible, and responsive experience:\n- Navbar offers smooth, scroll-aware navigation with mobile responsiveness and RTL support.\n- NavLink integrates cleanly with React Router for active-state styling.\n- LanguageSwitcher updates language and triggers RTL layout changes via LanguageContext.\n- ScrollToTop improves usability on long pages.\n\nBy following the troubleshooting steps and performance tips, you can maintain reliability and performance across languages and devices.\n\n[No sources needed since this section summarizes without analyzing specific files]\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Example: Event-Driven Navigation Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Navbar as \"Navbar.tsx\"\n  participant DOM as \"DOM Sections\"\n  User-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Click navigation link\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Prevent default anchor behavior\n  Navbar-\u003e\u003eDOM: Scroll to target section with smooth behavior\n  Navbar--\u003e\u003eUser: View aligned to target section\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L29-L36)\n\n### Example: Language Change Flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant LangSwitch as \"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"\n  participant Ctx as \"LanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant App as \"App.tsx\"\n  User-\u003e\u003eLangSwitch: Select language\n  LangSwitch-\u003e\u003eCtx: setLanguage(code)\n  Ctx--\u003e\u003eApp: Update language and isRTL\n  App--\u003e\u003eUser: Updated labels and layout direction\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L291)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-abe6672a-3742-4697-af6b-5e2f3d3e32bf","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":26332,"completion_tokens":3718,"total_tokens":30050,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
