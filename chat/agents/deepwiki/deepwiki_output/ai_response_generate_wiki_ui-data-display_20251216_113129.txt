Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for components that visualize data.

[eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L108)\n\n## Multilingual Date Support\n\nThe application supports multilingual date formatting through integration with date-fns, enabling proper display of dates in Arabic, English, and Turkish languages.\n\n### Date Formatting Implementation\nThe event data includes pre-formatted dates in Arabic, but the application can dynamically format dates based on the current language setting:\n\n- **Arabic**: Uses Arabic numerals and Arabic month names\n- **English**: Uses Western numerals and English month names\n- **Turkish**: Uses Western numerals and Turkish month names\n\nThe date formatting follows cultural conventions for each language, including proper numeral systems and date order.\n\n### Language Context Integration\nThe application uses a LanguageContext to manage the current language setting, which affects date display:\n\n- Language switching triggers re-rendering of date components\n- Date formatting functions adapt to the current language\n- Calendar components display weekday and month names in the appropriate language\n\nThis ensures consistent multilingual support across all date-related components.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L7-L9)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L172-L184)\n\n## Accessibility Implementation\n\nThe data display components include comprehensive accessibility features to ensure usability for all users, including those with disabilities.\n\n### Table Accessibility\nThe Table component implements several

implementation.\n\n### Badge Usage in Speakers Section\nThe Badge component is used to display speaker roles in the SpeakersSection component. Each speaker's role is displayed as a badge with appropriate styling:\n\n- **Implementation**: Speaker roles are rendered as text content within the component\n- **Styling**: Roles are displayed with consistent typography and spacing\n- **Accessibility**: Role information is properly associated with the speaker\n\nThe component uses language-specific role information (Arabic, English, Turkish) based on the current language setting.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant LanguageContext\n    participant SpeakersSection\n    participant Speaker\n    participant Badge\n    \n    LanguageContext-\u003e\u003eSpeakersSection: Provides current language\n    SpeakersSection-\u003e\u003eSpeaker: Maps speakers with language-specific data\n    Speaker-\u003e\u003eSpeakersSection: Returns name and role in current language\n    SpeakersSection-\u003e\u003eBadge: Renders role as styled text\n    Badge-\u003e\u003eUI: Displays role with consistent styling\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L174-L184)\n- [badge.tsx](file://src/components/ui/badge.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L237)\n\n### Avatar Usage in Speakers Section\nThe Avatar component is used to display speaker images in the SpeakersSection component:\n\n- **Image loading**: Speaker images are imported and displayed using the AvatarImage component\n- **Fallback handling**: When images are not available, a fallback icon is displayed\n- **Accessibility**: Alt text is provided for screen readers\n- **Styling**: Consistent size and border radius for all avatars\n\nThe component handles both speakers with images and those without, providing a consistent user experience.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    Start([Component Render]) --\u003e CheckImage[\"Check if speaker has image\"]\n    CheckImage --\u003e|Yes| DisplayAvatarImage[\"Display AvatarImage with src\"]\n    CheckImage --\u003e|No| DisplayAvatarFallback[\"Display AvatarFallback with icon\"]\n    DisplayAvatarImage --\u003e ApplyStyling[\"Apply consistent styling\"]\n    DisplayAvatarFallback --\u003e ApplyStyling\n    ApplyStyling --\u003e End([Render Avatar])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L209-L219)\n- [avatar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/avatar.tsx)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L171-L237)\n\n### Progress Usage in Countdown Timer\nThe Progress component concept is implemented in the CountdownTimer component, which visualizes the time remaining until the event:\n\n- **Time calculation**: The component calculates days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining\n- **Visual representation**: Each time unit is displayed in a separate container\n- **Animation**: Values update every second with smooth transitions\n- **Multilingual support**: Time unit labels are translated based on the current language\n\nAlthough the component doesn't use the Progress component directly, it follows a similar pattern of visualizing progress toward an event.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant CountdownTimer\n    participant Date\n    participant State\n    participant UI\n    \n    CountdownTimer-\u003e\u003eDate: Get current date\n    Date-\u003e\u003eCountdownTimer: Return current timestamp\n    CountdownTimer-\u003e\u003eCountdownTimer: Calculate time difference\n    CountdownTimer-\u003e\u003eState: Update timeLeft state\n    State-\u003e\u003eUI: Render time units\n    UI-\u003e\u003eUI: Format values with leading zeros\n    UI-\u003e\u003eUI: Apply language-specific labels\n    loop Every second\n        CountdownTimer-\u003e\u003eCountdownTimer: Recalculate time\n    end\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L11-L77)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L11-L77)\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n\nThis section addresses common issues that may arise when using the data display components and provides solutions.\n\n### Table Overflow on Mobile\nOne common issue is table content overflowing on mobile devices due to limited screen width.\n\n**Symptoms**:\n- Horizontal scrolling is required to view all table content\n- Table cells are compressed or text is truncated\n- Layout breaks on smaller screens\n\n**Solutions**:\n1. Ensure the Table component is wrapped in a responsive container with overflow-x-auto\n2. Use responsive typography classes to adjust font sizes on smaller screens\n3. Implement horizontal scrolling for wide tables\n4. Consider alternative layouts for mobile devices (e.g., card-based layout)\n\nThe current Table implementation already includes overflow handling with the \"relative w-full overflow-auto\" wrapper, which should prevent most overflow issues.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [table.tsx](file://src/components/ui/table.tsx#L7)\n\n### Chart Rendering Performance\nComplex charts with large datasets may experience performance issues, particularly on lower-end devices.\n\n**Symptoms**:\n- Slow rendering of chart components\n- Lag when interacting with charts\n- High memory usage\n\n**Solutions**:\n1. Implement data sampling for large datasets\n2. Use lazy loading for charts that are not immediately visible\n3. Optimize chart configuration to reduce unnecessary re-renders\n4. Consider using simpler chart types for mobile devices\n\nThe ChartContainer component uses Recharts' ResponsiveContainer, which helps optimize rendering performance by only rendering when the container is visible.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [chart.tsx](file://src/components/ui/chart.tsx#L54)\n\n### Accessibility Issues\nAccessibility problems may occur if components are not used correctly.\n\n**Common Issues**:\n1. Missing alt text for images in Avatar components\n2. Insufficient color contrast in Badge components\n3. Inaccessible table navigation\n4. Missing ARIA labels for interactive elements\n\n**Solutions**:\n1. Always provide meaningful alt text for Avatar images\n2. Test color contrast ratios to ensure accessibility\n3. Ensure keyboard navigation works for all interactive elements\n4. Use semantic HTML and ARIA attributes appropriately\n\nThe components are designed with accessibility in mind, but proper usage is essential to maintain accessibility standards.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [avatar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/avatar.tsx#L22)\n- [table.tsx](file://src/components/ui/table.tsx)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe data display components in the Syrian Community Liberation Day event website provide a comprehensive set of tools for visualizing structured information, metrics, status tags, participant images, countdowns, and date information. These components are well-integrated with the eventData.ts file and support multilingual date formatting through date-fns. The components include robust accessibility features, support extensive styling customization through Tailwind classes and theme variables, and are used effectively in real-world examples throughout the application. By following the guidance in this documentation, developers can effectively use and extend these components to meet the needs of the event website while maintaining consistency, accessibility, and performance.\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-26f8b3ec-0d37-4584-84c8-a52e453fb4f3","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":28680,"completion_tokens":4438,"total_tokens":33118,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
