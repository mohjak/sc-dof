Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive documentation for the HeroSection component, which serves as the primary landing view of the event platform. Explain its role in displaying the event's main branding elements including the Syrian eagle emblem, flag, title, and tagline with multilingual support via the useLanguage hook. Detail how it integrates the CountdownTimer component and uses animated entrance effects (fade-up, float) for visual engagement. Document its responsive layout using Tailwind's grid and spacing utilities, background image handling with overlay gradients, and decorative confetti animation system. Include how RTL layout is managed through the language context, and describe the CTA button's scroll navigation behavior to the 'why' section. Provide examples of how translation keys like 'hero.title' and 'hero.date' are resolved from the i18n system, and explain performance considerations such as image loading and animation optimization.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nHero Section\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It showcases the event’s main branding elements—Syrian eagle emblem, flag, title, and tagline—while delivering a visually engaging experience through animated entrance effects and a decorative confetti system. It integrates the CountdownTimer component to display the time remaining until the event and provides a call-to-action (CTA) button that scrolls the user to the “Why” section. Multilingual support is powered by the LanguageContext, enabling translations for keys such as hero.title, hero.subtitle, hero.tagline, hero.date, hero.day, and hero.discoverMore. The component also manages RTL layout via the language context and applies responsive design using Tailwind utilities. Background image handling uses overlay gradients for readability, and the CTA button navigates smoothly to the WhySection anchor.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe HeroSection is part of the components layer and is rendered by the Index page. It relies on shared design tokens and animations defined in the global stylesheet and Tailwind configuration.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  Index[\"Index Page\u003cbr/\u003erenders HeroSection\"]

[CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### Internationalization and RTL\nTranslation resolution:\n- The t() function resolves keys such as hero.title, hero.subtitle, hero.tagline, hero.date, hero.day, and hero.discoverMore from the LanguageContext translations object.\n- Fallback behavior returns the key itself if a translation is missing.\n\nRTL support:\n- The isRTL flag is true when language is Arabic.\n- The App root sets dir=\"rtl\" for Arabic and dir=\"ltr\" otherwise.\n- Font switching: Arabic uses Koufiya; English and Turkish use Roboto.\n\nLanguageSwitcher:\n- Provides buttons to switch languages and reflects the active language with visual emphasis.\n- Uses emoji flags for English and Turkish and a custom Syrian flag image for Arabic.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n### Visual Design Tokens and Animations\nColor palette and gradients:\n- Custom tokens define Syrian red/green/black, gold, and cream.\n- Gradient utilities are used for hero backgrounds and glows.\n\nTypography:\n- Tailwind fontFamily includes Koufiya and Roboto.\n- HeroSection uses responsive text sizes and shadows for legibility.\n\nAnimations:\n- fade-up: Smooth entrance with opacity and vertical movement.\n- float: Continuous vertical bounce for the eagle emblem.\n- confetti-fall: Randomized falling animation across the screen.\n\nStaggered delays:\n- delay-100, delay-200, delay-300, delay-400, delay-500 classes apply progressive delays for entrance sequences.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n### Scroll Navigation Behavior\n- The CTA button in HeroSection uses an anchor link to navigate to the “Why” section.\n- Smooth scrolling is enabled globally via the HTML scroll-behavior setting.\n- The WhySection defines the anchor target with an id.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L83-L93)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L135-L142)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nHeroSection depends on:\n- LanguageContext for translations and RTL state.\n- CountdownTimer for dynamic time display.\n- Global styles for animations and design tokens.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  Hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"] --\u003e Lang[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  Hero --\u003e Timer[\"CountdownTimer.tsx\"]\n  Hero --\u003e CSS[\"index.css\"]\n  Hero --\u003e

[App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Background image handling:\n  - The hero background uses a large image with a gradient overlay. Consider lazy-loading strategies for large images and optimizing image formats for faster delivery.\n  - Overlay gradients reduce contrast issues but can increase render cost; ensure the gradient is lightweight and not overly complex.\n\n- Animated confetti:\n  - Rendering 15 confetti elements with random properties can be heavy on low-end devices. Consider reducing the count or disabling animations on smaller viewports.\n  - Use transform-based animations (already used) for GPU acceleration.\n\n- CountdownTimer:\n  - Updates every second; keep the component lightweight. Avoid unnecessary re-renders by memoizing calculations if needed.\n\n- Fonts:\n  - Koufiya and Roboto fonts are loaded via @font-face and Tailwind font families. Ensure fonts are preloaded or cached to prevent layout shifts.\n\n- Accessibility:\n  - Alt texts are present for branding images.\n  - Ensure sufficient color contrast against overlays and maintain readable font sizes across languages.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Translation keys not appearing:\n  - Verify that the keys hero.title, hero.subtitle, hero.tagline, hero.date, hero.day, and hero.discoverMore exist in the LanguageContext translations for the active language.\n  - Confirm that the LanguageProvider is wrapping the application and that useLanguage is used inside HeroSection.\n\n- RTL layout issues:\n  - Ensure the App root receives isRTL from LanguageContext and sets dir accordingly.\n  - Confirm font switching logic applies Koufiya for Arabic and Roboto for English/Turkish.\n\n- Confetti animation anomalies:\n  - Check that the confetti container is positioned absolutely and covers the viewport.\n  - Reduce the number of confetti elements or disable animations on mobile if performance is poor.\n\n- CTA not scrolling:\n  - Ensure the WhySection has the correct anchor id and that the CTA link points to the same id.\n  - Confirm smooth scrolling is enabled globally.\n\n- CountdownTimer not updating:\n  - Verify the event date is correctly defined and that the interval cleanup occurs on unmount.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L267-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [CountdownTimer.tsx](file://src/components/CountdownTimer.tsx#L1-L78)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L135-L142)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe HeroSection delivers a rich, multilingual, and animated landing experience for the event platform. It integrates branding, countdown timing, and navigation while leveraging Tailwind utilities and global animations for visual polish. Through LanguageContext, it supports Arabic, English, and Turkish with proper RTL handling and font switching. The component’s responsive design and decorative confetti enhance engagement, while careful performance considerations help maintain smooth interactions across devices.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-7048be08-65f7-4709-9ee4-28c05b20aab9","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":34993,"completion_tokens":3507,"total_tokens":38500,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
