Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate detailed documentation for layout utility components that structure content. Explain Accordion for collapsible sections (e.g., FAQ), AspectRatio for media containers, Collapsible for expandable content, Resizable for draggable splitters, ScrollArea for custom scrollable regions, and Skeleton for loading states. Document their implementation with Radix primitives and Tailwind styling. Provide usage examples: AspectRatio in speaker images, Skeleton in loading states during language switch. Highlight accessibility features like aria-expanded and role=\"region\". Address responsive behavior and RTL compatibility.

These components include Accordion, AspectRatio, Collapsible, Resizable, ScrollArea, and Skeleton, all implemented using Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS. The components are designed to enhance user experience through accessible, responsive, and performant interfaces. Special attention is given to accessibility features such as `aria-expanded` and `role=\"region\"`, responsive behavior across devices, and RTL compatibility for Arabic language support.\n\n## Core Layout Components\n\nThe layout utility components are built on top of Radix UI primitives, ensuring accessibility and robust functionality while leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling. These components are located in the `src/components/ui/` directory and are designed to be reusable across the application. They follow a consistent pattern of wrapping Radix primitives with custom styling and additional functionality.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx)\n- [aspect-ratio.tsx](file://src/components/ui/aspect-ratio.tsx)\n- [collapsible.tsx](file://src/components/ui/collapsible.tsx)\n- [resizable.tsx](file://src/components/ui/resizable.tsx)\n- [scroll-area.tsx](file://src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx)\n- [skeleton.tsx](file://src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx)\n\n## Accordion Component\n\nThe Accordion component provides a collapsible interface for managing content sections, commonly used for FAQ sections or grouped information. It is built using `@radix-ui/react-accordion` and includes three main parts: `Accordion`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger`, and `AccordionContent`.\n\nThe component uses the `data-state` attribute to manage open/closed states, with corresponding animations (`data-[state=closed]:animate-accordion-up` and `data-[state=open]:animate-accordion-down`). The trigger includes a rotating chevron icon (ChevronDown from lucide-react) that rotates 180 degrees when expanded, providing visual feedback to users.\n\nAccessibility features include proper ARIA attributes managed by Radix primitives, with `aria-expanded` automatically applied to triggers. The component supports keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility out of the box.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Accordion {\n        +Root: AccordionPrimitive.Root\n        +Item: AccordionPrimitive.Item\n        +Trigger: AccordionPrimitive.Trigger\n        +Content: AccordionPrimitive.Content\n    }\n    \n    Accordion --\u003e AccordionPrimitive : \"uses\"\n    AccordionTrigger --\u003e ChevronDown : \"displays\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx#L7-L52)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [accordion.tsx](file://src/components/ui/accordion.tsx#L1-L53)\n\n## AspectRatio Component\n\nThe AspectRatio component ensures consistent aspect ratios for media containers, particularly useful for images and videos. It is implemented using `@radix-ui/react-aspect-ratio` and provides a simple wrapper that maintains the desired aspect ratio regardless of screen size.\n\nThe component is minimal in implementation, essentially serving as a direct wrapper around the Radix primitive. This simplicity ensures reliable performance and predictable behavior across different use cases.\n\nA primary usage example is in the SpeakersSection, where speaker images need to maintain a consistent visual presentation across different devices and screen sizes.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class AspectRatio {\n        +Root: AspectRatioPrimitive.Root\n    }\n    \n    AspectRatio --\u003e AspectRatioPrimitive : \"wraps\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [aspect-ratio.tsx](file://src/components/ui/aspect-ratio.tsx#L3-L5)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [aspect-ratio.tsx](file://src/components/ui/aspect-ratio.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L209-L214)\n\n## Collapsible Component\n\nThe Collapsible component provides expandable content sections with smooth animations. It is built using `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` and includes three main components: `Collapsible`, `CollapsibleTrigger`, and `CollapsibleContent`.\n\nThe implementation is straightforward, directly exposing the Radix primitives with minimal customization. This approach ensures maximum compatibility with Radix's accessibility features while allowing for easy styling through Tailwind CSS.\n\nThe component can be used for various purposes, such as hiding/showing additional information, creating expandable navigation menus, or implementing show/hide functionality for content sections.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Collapsible {\n        +Root: CollapsiblePrimitive.Root\n        +Trigger: CollapsiblePrimitive.Trigger\n        +Content: CollapsiblePrimitive.Content\n    }\n    \n    Collapsible --\u003e CollapsiblePrimitive : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [collapsible.tsx](file://src/components/ui/collapsible.tsx#L3-L9)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [collapsible.tsx](file://src/components/ui/collapsible.tsx#L1-L10)\n\n## Resizable Component\n\nThe Resizable component enables draggable splitters for resizable panels, allowing users to adjust the size of adjacent content areas. It is implemented using `react-resizable-panels` rather than Radix UI, indicating a specialized use case for panel resizing.\n\nThe component suite includes `ResizablePanelGroup`, `ResizablePanel`, and `ResizableHandle`. The handle component includes an optional grip visual (GripVertical icon from lucide-react) that appears when `withHandle` is true, providing a clear visual cue for draggable areas.\n\nThe implementation includes responsive considerations, with different styles applied based on the panel group direction (vertical or horizontal), ensuring proper display and interaction in both orientations.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Resizable {\n        +PanelGroup: ResizablePrimitive.PanelGroup\n        +Panel: ResizablePrimitive.Panel\n        +Handle: ResizablePrimitive.PanelResizeHandle\n    }\n    \n    Resizable --\u003e ResizablePrimitive : \"uses\"\n    ResizableHandle --\u003e GripVertical : \"displays when withHandle\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [resizable.tsx](file://src/components/ui/resizable.tsx#L6-L37)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [resizable.tsx](file://src/components/ui/resizable.tsx#L1-L38)\n\n## ScrollArea Component\n\nThe ScrollArea component provides custom scrollable regions with styled scrollbars, implemented using `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area`. It replaces native browser scrollbars with a consistent, styled alternative that matches the application's design language.\n\nThe component includes `ScrollArea` and `ScrollBar` subcomponents, with the scrollbar supporting both vertical and horizontal orientations. The styling uses Tailwind classes to create a subtle, modern scrollbar that appears only when needed, with smooth transitions and hover effects.\n\nAccessibility is maintained through Radix's implementation, ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility while providing a better visual experience than native scrollbars.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class ScrollArea {\n        +Root: ScrollAreaPrimitive.Root\n        +Viewport: ScrollAreaPrimitive.Viewport\n        +Scrollbar: ScrollAreaPrimitive.ScrollAreaScrollbar\n        +Thumb: ScrollAreaPrimitive.ScrollAreaThumb\n        +Corner: ScrollAreaPrimitive.Corner\n    }\n    \n    ScrollArea --\u003e ScrollAreaPrimitive : \"uses\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [scroll-area.tsx](file://src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx#L6-L38)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [scroll-area.tsx](file://src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx#L1-L39)\n\n## Skeleton Component\n\nThe Skeleton component provides loading state placeholders that help prevent layout shifts and improve perceived performance. It is implemented as a simple div with animated background and rounded styling.\n\nThe component uses Tailwind's `animate-pulse` class to create a subtle pulsing animation that indicates loading content. The styling includes `bg-muted` for the background color and `rounded-md` for consistent corner treatment with other UI elements.\n\nA key usage example is during language switching, where content needs to be reloaded or re-rendered. The skeleton provides immediate visual feedback while the new language content is being prepared, maintaining a smooth user experience.\n\nThe implementation is minimal but effective, focusing on preventing layout shifts by reserving space for content before it loads.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Skeleton {\n        +className: string\n        +props: React.HTMLAttributes\u003cHTMLDivElement\u003e\n    }\n    \n    Skeleton --\u003e \"animate-pulse\" : \"applies\"\n    Skeleton --\u003e \"bg-muted\" : \"applies\"\n    Skeleton --\u003e \"rounded-md\" : \"applies\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [skeleton.tsx](file://src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx#L3-L7)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [skeleton.tsx](file://src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx#L1-L8)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L34-L35)\n\n## Accessibility and Responsive Design\n\nThe layout components prioritize accessibility and responsive design, ensuring compatibility across devices and assistive technologies.\n\n### Accessibility Features\nAll components leverage Radix UI primitives, which automatically handle many accessibility concerns:\n- Proper ARIA attributes (aria-expanded, role=\"region\", etc.)\n- Keyboard navigation support\n- Screen reader compatibility\n- Focus management\n\nThe Accordion and Collapsible components specifically use `aria-expanded` to indicate their open/closed state, which is automatically managed by Radix primitives. The components also support keyboard interactions like Enter/Space to toggle states and arrow keys to navigate between items.\n\n### RTL Compatibility\nThe application supports RTL (Right-to-Left) layout for Arabic language users. This is managed through the LanguageContext, which provides an `isRTL` flag that components can use to adjust their layout.\n\nWhen the language is set to 'ar' (Arabic), the `isRTL` flag is true, triggering RTL layout adjustments throughout the application. This affects text alignment, component positioning, and navigation flow to accommodate right-to-left reading patterns.\n\n### Responsive Behavior\nAll layout components are designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes:\n- Mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive prefixes\n- Flexible layouts that adapt to available space\n- Touch-friendly targets for mobile devices\n- Appropriate spacing and sizing across breakpoints\n\nThe components work seamlessly with Tailwind's responsive utilities, allowing developers to easily customize behavior at different breakpoints.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L276-L277)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L36-L37)\n- [utils.ts](file://src/lib/utils.ts#L4-L6)\n\n## Performance Optimization\n\nThe layout components include several performance optimization strategies to ensure smooth user experiences.\n\n### Lazy Loading Content\nFor collapsible sections, content should be lazy-loaded to improve initial page performance. This means rendering content only when a section is expanded, rather than pre-rendering all content upfront.\n\nThis approach reduces the initial JavaScript bundle size and DOM complexity, leading to faster load times and improved performance, especially for pages with many collapsible sections.\n\n### Preventing Layout Shifts\nThe Skeleton component plays a crucial role in preventing layout shifts during loading states. By reserving space for content before it loads, it maintains a stable layout and prevents the \"jumping content\" effect that can be disorienting to users.\n\nDuring language switching, skeleton placeholders provide immediate visual feedback while the new language content is being prepared, creating a smoother transition experience.\n\n### Efficient Rendering\nThe components are designed for efficient rendering:\n- Minimal re-renders through proper React component design\n- Use of React.forwardRef for proper ref handling without unnecessary re-renders\n- Memoization where appropriate\n- Efficient event handling\n\nThe combination of Radix primitives and Tailwind CSS ensures that the components are both performant and visually consistent across the application.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [skeleton.tsx](file://src/components/ui/skeleton.tsx#L3-L7)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L14-L43)\n- [SpeakersSection.tsx](file://src/components/SpeakersSection.tsx#L172-L184)\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-1ee929f6-1683-4282-b3a8-fca906e5719d","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":28135,"completion_tokens":2904,"total_tokens":31039,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
