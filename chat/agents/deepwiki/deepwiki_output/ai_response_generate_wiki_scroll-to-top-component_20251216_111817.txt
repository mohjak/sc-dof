Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive documentation for the ScrollToTop component, explaining its purpose in enhancing user experience by providing quick navigation to the top of the page. Detail the implementation of visibility logic using useState and useEffect, where the button appears only when the user scrolls beyond 300px. Describe the smooth scrolling behavior achieved through window.scrollTo with 'smooth' behavior and the use of the ArrowUp Lucide icon for visual indication. Explain the animated appearance and disappearance using conditional Tailwind classes that control opacity and transform (translate-y) states, along with pointer-events-none to prevent interaction when hidden. Cover accessibility considerations such as aria-label and keyboard navigation support. Include practical examples of event listener setup and cleanup in useEffect to prevent memory leaks. Discuss performance implications of scroll event listeners and recommend best practices like throttling or debouncing for high-frequency events. Provide real code examples from the component to demonstrate implementation patterns and integration with the global scroll state.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nScrollToTop Component\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It appears when the user scrolls down beyond a threshold and smoothly scrolls the viewport back to the top when clicked. The component uses React hooks for visibility state and scroll event handling, Tailwind classes for animations and layout, and the ArrowUp Lucide icon for visual indication. Accessibility is supported via aria-label, and the component cleans up event listeners to prevent memory leaks.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe ScrollToTop component is integrated into the main page layout and styled using the project’s Tailwind configuration and global CSS.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Pages\"\n    IDX[\"Index.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Components\"\n    ST[\"ScrollToTop.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Styling\"\n    CSS[\"index.css\"]\n    TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  IDX --\u003e ST\n  ST --\u003e CSS\n  ST --\u003e TW\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Core Components\n- ScrollToTop: A floating button that toggles visibility based on scroll position and triggers smooth scroll to the top on click.\n- Integration: Included in the main page layout so it is present across routes.\n\nKey implementation highlights:\n- Visibility logic: Uses useState to track whether the button should be visible and useEffect to attach and detach a scroll event listener.\n- Smooth scrolling: Calls window.scrollTo with smooth behavior to return to the top.\n- Animation and layout: Conditional Tailwind classes animate opacity and vertical translation; pointer-events-none hides the button from interaction when not visible.\n- Accessibility: Provides aria-label for screen readers.\n- Cleanup: Removes the scroll event listener in the effect cleanup to avoid memory leaks.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L10-L26)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe component participates in the page lifecycle and interacts with the browser’s scroll system and DOM.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Window as \"Window\"\n  participant ST as \"ScrollToTop\"\n  participant DOM as \"DOM\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eWindow: \"Scroll\"\n  Window-\u003e\u003eST: \"scroll event\"\n  ST-\u003e\u003eST: \"toggle visibility based on scrollY\"\n  ST-\u003e\u003eDOM: \"update className (opacity/transform)\"\n  User-\u003e\u003eST: \"Click button\"\n  ST-\u003e\u003eWindow: \"scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })\"\n  Window--\u003e\u003eUser: \"Smooth scroll to top\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Visibility Logic with useState and useEffect\n- State: A boolean flag determines whether the button is visible.\n- Effect: Attaches a scroll handler that updates the visibility state based on window.scrollY exceeding a threshold.\n- Cleanup: Removes the scroll listener when the component unmounts.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"Mount component\"]) --\u003e AddListener[\"Add scroll listener\"]\n  AddListener --\u003e OnScroll[\"On scroll: compare scrollY to threshold\"]\n  OnScroll --\u003e Visible{\"scrollY \u003e threshold?\"}\n  Visible --\u003e|Yes| SetVisibleTrue[\"Set isVisible = true\"]\n  Visible --\u003e|No| SetVisibleFalse[\"Set isVisible = false\"]\n  SetVisibleTrue --\u003e UpdateUI[\"Update className for visible state\"]\n  SetVisibleFalse --\u003e UpdateUI\n  UpdateUI --\u003e RemoveListener[\"On unmount: remove scroll listener\"]\n  RemoveListener --\u003e End([\"Unmount\"])\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n\n### Smooth Scrolling Behavior\n- The component triggers window.scrollTo with smooth behavior to return to the top of the page.\n- Global CSS sets scroll-behavior to smooth, which affects native anchor scrolling; the component’s explicit smooth option ensures consistent behavior for programmatic navigation.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant ST as \"ScrollToTop\"\n  participant Window as \"Window\"\n  ST-\u003e\u003eWindow: \"scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'smooth' })\"\n  Window--\u003e\u003eST: \"Scroll animation completes\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L20-L25)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L130-L142)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L20-L25)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L130-L142)\n\n### Animated Appearance and Disappearance\n- Conditional Tailwind classes control opacity and vertical translation to animate the button’s entrance and exit.\n- pointer-events-none prevents interaction when the button is hidden.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Hidden[\"Hidden state\u003cbr/\u003eopacity-0 translate-y-10 pointer-events-none\"] --\u003e Visible[\"Visible state\u003cbr/\u003eopacity-100 translate-y-0\"]\n  Visible --\u003e Hidden\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L27-L37)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L27-L37)\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n- aria-label provides a screen-reader-friendly label for the button.\n- Keyboard navigation: The button is a standard HTML button and receives focus via tab order; ensure focus styles align with the project’s design system.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L28-L36)\n\n### Integration with the Page Layout\n- The component is included in the main page layout so it remains visible across routes.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L10-L26)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Internal dependencies:\n  - React hooks: useState and useEffect for state and side effects.\n  - Lucide icon: ArrowUp for visual indication.\n- External dependencies:\n  - Tailwind CSS classes for styling and animations.\n  - Global CSS defines color tokens and scroll behavior.\n  - Tailwind configuration extends colors and fonts used by the component.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  ST[\"ScrollToTop.tsx\"] --\u003e REACT[\"React Hooks\"]\n  ST --\u003e ICON[\"Lucide ArrowUp\"]\n  ST --\u003e TWCSS[\"Tailwind Classes\"]\n  ST --\u003e THEME[\"Tailwind Theme\"]\n  ST --\u003e GLOBALCSS[\"Global CSS\"]\n  THEME --\u003e COLORS[\"Color Tokens\"]\n  THEME --\u003e FONTS[\"Font Families\"]\n  GLOBALCSS --\u003e SCROLL[\"scroll-behavior smooth\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L1-L41)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://src/tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Scroll event frequency: Scroll events fire frequently and can cause layout thrashing if not optimized. The current implementation performs a simple comparison and state update, which is lightweight.\n- Recommended optimizations:\n  - Debounce or throttle the scroll handler to limit re-renders.\n  - Use passive event listeners where appropriate.\n  - Consider IntersectionObserver for detecting visibility thresholds instead of scroll events for heavy pages.\n- Memory leak prevention: The effect already removes the scroll listener on unmount, which is essential.\n\nPractical example references:\n- Event listener setup and cleanup in useEffect: [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L7-L18)\n- Similar pattern in Navbar: [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L14-L16)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L7-L18)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L14-L16)\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Button does not appear:\n  - Verify the scroll threshold and initial state. The component sets visibility based on scrollY exceeding the threshold.\n  - Confirm the component is rendered in the page layout.\n- Button does not disappear:\n  - Ensure the scroll listener is attached and the effect runs. Check for early returns or conditional rendering preventing mount.\n- Click does nothing:\n  - Confirm window.scrollTo is supported and not blocked by browser policies.\n  - Verify the button is not hidden by pointer-events-none when not visible.\n- Accessibility issues:\n  - Ensure the aria-label is present and meaningful.\n  - Test keyboard focus and ensure focus visibility is adequate.\n\nIntegration references:\n- Component inclusion in the page: [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L10-L26)\n- Scroll listener pattern: [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L7-L18)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L10-L26)\n- [ScrollToTop.tsx](file://src/components/ScrollToTop.tsx#L7-L18)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe ScrollToTop component provides a simple yet effective way to improve navigation on long pages. It uses React hooks for state and side effects, Tailwind for smooth animations and layout, and Lucide for a clear visual indicator. With proper cleanup and potential performance enhancements like debouncing, it integrates cleanly into the application’s UI and supports accessibility standards.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-c0129c81-50f2-424c-9c9f-cba64a586cc0","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":24328,"completion_tokens":2551,"total_tokens":26879,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
