Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed documentation for the AgendaSection component that displays the event schedule in a responsive card grid. Explain how it sources agenda items from translation files using the t() function for time, title, and description, and maps them with corresponding icons from agendaIcons. Describe the component's responsive design using Tailwind's grid system (1 column on mobile, 2 on tablet, 3 on desktop) and its interactive hover effects including shadow elevation, translation, and gradient accent animations. Document the structure of each agenda card, including time badges with Syrian green styling, hierarchical typography, and icon integration. Address accessibility considerations such as proper heading levels and focus states, and explain how the component adapts to RTL layouts when Arabic is selected. Include guidance on adding new agenda items and ensuring consistent translation key naming.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nAgenda Section\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers how agenda items are sourced from translation files using the t() function, how icons are mapped, the responsive grid layout, interactive hover effects, card structure (including time badges, typography, and icons), accessibility considerations, and how the component adapts to RTL layouts when Arabic is selected. It also provides guidance on adding new agenda items and maintaining consistent translation key naming.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe AgendaSection component is located under src/components and integrates with the internationalization system in src/contexts. The translation keys for agenda items are defined in LanguageContext.tsx. The app’s root container applies directionality and fonts based on the selected language.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Components\"\n    AS[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Internationalization\"\n    LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n    LS[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"App Root\"\n    APP[\"App.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Styling\"\n    CSS[\"index.css\"]\n    TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Data\"\n    ED[\"eventData.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  AS --\u003e LC\n  LS --\u003e LC\n  APP --\u003e LC\n  AS --\u003e CSS\n  AS --\u003e TW\n  ED -. alternative data source .-\u003e AS\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L47-L84)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L47-L84)\n\n## Core Components\n- AgendaSection: Renders a responsive grid of agenda cards, sourcing content via t(), mapping icons from a predefined list, and applying interactive hover effects.\n- LanguageContext: Provides the t() function, language state, and isRTL flag used by AgendaSection and other components.\n- LanguageSwitcher: Allows changing the language, which updates all translated content including agenda items.\n- App: Applies directionality (dir) and font family based on the current language.\n\nKey responsibilities:\n- AgendaSection: Translation integration, responsive grid, hover animations, card structure.\n- LanguageContext: Translation dictionary, fallback behavior, RTL detection.\n- LanguageSwitcher: Language selection UI and persistence.\n- App: Global direction and font application.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe AgendaSection component depends on the LanguageContext for translations and on global styles for colors and responsive breakpoints. The LanguageSwitcher updates the language, which triggers re-renders across the app, including the AgendaSection.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant Switcher as \"LanguageSwitcher\"\n  participant Provider as \"LanguageProvider\"\n  participant Context as \"useLanguage()\"\n  participant Agenda as \"AgendaSection\"\n  participant Translations as \"translations\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eSwitcher: Click language button\n  Switcher-\u003e\u003eProvider: setLanguage(code)\n  Provider--\u003e\u003eContext: language updated\n  Context--\u003e\u003eAgenda: t() resolves keys\n  Agenda-\u003e\u003eTranslations: resolve agenda keys\n  Translations--\u003e\u003eAgenda: localized strings\n  Agenda--\u003e\u003eUser: Updated agenda cards\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### AgendaSection Component\nResponsibilities:\n- Source agenda items from translation keys using t().\n- Map a static list of emoji icons to agenda entries.\n- Render a responsive grid of cards with hover effects.\n- Display time badges styled with Syrian green.\n- Apply hierarchical typography and integrate icons.\n\nResponsive grid:\n- Mobile: 1 column (grid-cols-1)\n- Tablet: 2 columns (sm:grid-cols-2)\n- Desktop: 3 columns (lg:grid-cols-3)\n- Gap and max width controlled for readability.\n\nHover effects:\n- Shadow elevation increase (hover:shadow-xl)\n- Subtle upward lift (hover:-translate-y-1)\n- Smooth transitions (transition-all duration-300)\n- Gradient accent circle scales on hover (group-hover:scale-150)\n\nCard structure:\n- Relative container with rounded corners and border.\n- Absolute gradient accent circle positioned at top-right, scaled on hover.\n- Inner content with icon and text stack.\n- Time badge styled with Syrian green.\n- Title and description with appropriate typography and muted colors.\n\nAccessibility considerations:\n- Heading levels: The section title is an h2; individual agenda items are rendered as headings inside cards. Ensure semantic headings match content hierarchy. Consider wrapping each agenda item in a heading element if needed for screen readers.\n- Focus states: Hover effects are present; ensure keyboard focus visibility is maintained by default browser focus rings or custom focus styles.\n- Language direction: When Arabic is selected, the app sets dir=\"rtl\" at the root, which affects layout direction and alignment.\n\nRTL adaptation:\n- The root App component sets dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'} based on the current language.\n- Arabic triggers isRTL, which flips horizontal layout and alignment for the entire app.\n\nTranslation integration:\n- Uses t() to resolve agenda keys such as agenda.title, agenda.subtitle, and agenda.N.time/title/description.\n- Icons are mapped from a static array of emojis.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L56-L80)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n\n### Translation System (LanguageContext)\n- Provides t(key) that returns the localized string for the current language or falls back to the key itself.\n- Maintains translations for Arabic, English, and Turkish.\n- Exposes isRTL based on the current language.\n- Used by AgendaSection and other components to render localized content.\n\nKey translation keys for agenda:\n- agenda.title, agenda.subtitle\n- agenda.1.time, agenda.1.title, agenda.1.description\n- agenda.2.time, agenda.2.title, agenda.2.description\n- And so on up to agenda.7.\n\nFallback behavior:\n- If a translation key is missing, t() returns the key string unchanged.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n### LanguageSwitcher Integration\n- Offers buttons for Arabic, English, and Turkish.\n- Updates the language via setLanguage, which changes isRTL and triggers re-renders.\n- Font switching: The App component applies font-koufiya for Arabic and font-roboto for English/Turkish.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n\n### Styling and Theme\n- Custom color tokens include syrian-green and others defined in CSS variables.\n- Tailwind theme exposes syrian colors for direct usage in components.\n- Gradient accents and shadows are configured globally and used in AgendaSection.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n\n### Alternative Data Source (eventData.ts)\n- The eventData.ts file contains an agenda array with time, title, description, and icon fields.\n- While AgendaSection currently sources agenda items from translations, the eventData.ts file demonstrates an alternate data model that could be used to populate the component programmatically.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L47-L84)\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n  class LanguageProvider {\n    +language: \"ar\"|\"en\"|\"tr\"\n    +setLanguage(lang)\n

[AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L33-L58)\n\n### Accessibility Considerations\n- Heading levels: Ensure each agenda item has a proper heading element to convey hierarchy to assistive technologies.\n- Focus states: Maintain visible focus indicators for keyboard navigation.\n- Language direction: When Arabic is selected, the root dir is set to rtl, affecting layout and alignment.\n- Font choice: Arabic uses a specific font class; ensure readable line heights and contrast.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n\n### RTL Layout Adaptation\n- The LanguageContext determines isRTL based on the current language.\n- The App component sets dir={isRTL ? 'rtl' : 'ltr'} at the root.\n- This affects text alignment, icon positions, and layout mirroring across the app.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L272-L278)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  LC[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"] --\u003e AS[\"AgendaSection.tsx\"]\n  LC --\u003e LS[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  APP[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e LC\n  CSS[\"index.css\"] --\u003e AS\n  TW[\"tailwind.config.ts\"] --\u003e AS\n  ED[\"eventData.ts\"] -. alternative data .-\u003e AS\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L47-L84)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L55-L104)\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L44-L84)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L47-L84)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Translation resolution is O(1) per key via a lookup map.\n- Hover animations use CSS transitions; keep durations reasonable to avoid jank.\n- Grid layout relies on Tailwind utilities; ensure minimal reflows by avoiding excessive dynamic class toggles.\n- Consider memoizing agenda arrays if data becomes dynamic and expensive to compute.\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Missing translations:\n  - Symptoms: Keys appear as plain strings instead of localized content.\n  - Cause: Missing key in the current language’s translation dictionary.\n  - Fix: Add the key to the appropriate language section in the translation dictionary.\n\n- Incorrect agenda count or ordering:\n  - Cause: Mismatch between the number of entries and the number of translation keys.\n  - Fix: Ensure each agenda item has corresponding translation keys and that the mapping aligns with the intended order.\n\n- Hover effects not visible:\n  - Cause: Overriding CSS or disabled transitions.\n  - Fix: Verify Tailwind utilities and ensure no conflicting styles override hover classes.\n\n- RTL layout issues:\n  - Symptoms: Misaligned icons or text direction.\n  - Cause: Language not set to Arabic or missing dir attribute.\n  - Fix: Confirm LanguageSwitcher updates language and that App applies dir=\"rtl\".\n\n- Adding new agenda items:\n  - Steps:\n    - Add translation keys for the new item in all supported languages.\n    - Increment the numbering in the agenda mapping and ensure the icon mapping remains consistent.\n    - Verify responsive grid renders correctly across breakpoints.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L8-L16)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L20)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe AgendaSection component provides a clean, responsive display of event agenda items using the translation system. It leverages Tailwind utilities for responsive grids and interactive hover effects, integrates icons, and adapts to RTL layouts when Arabic is selected. By following the translation key naming convention and ensuring consistent icon mapping, new agenda items can be added reliably across languages.\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Translation Key Naming Guidance\n- Use the pattern: agenda.N.field where N is the agenda segment number and field is time, title, or description.\n- Maintain consistent numbering and language parity across all supported languages.\n- Keep icon mapping synchronized with agenda entries.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L56-L80)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L8-L16)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-751140ed-7608-4a7c-8cd6-67d01e043d84","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":34300,"completion_tokens":4354,"total_tokens":38654,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
