Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the LanguageContext implementation focused on the sc-dof platform's state management for multilingual functionality. Thoroughly explain how the LanguageContext is created using React's createContext and useContext hooks, with the LanguageContextType interface defining the structure of the context (language, setLanguage, t function, and isRTL flag). Document the initial language state set to 'ar' (Arabic) and how the setLanguage function updates this state. Explain the translation function (t) that retrieves localized strings from the nested translations object based on the current language, including fallback behavior when a key is not found. Detail how the isRTL boolean is derived from the current language to support right-to-left layout for Arabic. Provide concrete examples from the code showing how components consume the context via useLanguage hook. Address common issues such as context not being available outside the provider and provide solutions. Include performance considerations around re-renders and best practices for using the context efficiently across the application.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nLanguage Context Implementation\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It covers how the context is created and consumed, how language state is initialized and updated, how the translation function resolves localized strings, and how right-to-left (RTL) layout is supported. It also provides examples of component usage via the useLanguage hook and offers guidance on common pitfalls and performance best practices.\n\n## Project Structure\nThe language system is centered around a React context provider and a small set of components that consume it. The provider wraps the application, and consumers use a custom hook to access language state, translation function, and RTL flag.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Root\"\n    App[\"App.tsx\"]\n    Provider[\"LanguageProvider\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageContext.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"UI Consumers\"\n    Navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n    Hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n    Footer[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n    LangSwitcher[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  App --\u003e Provider\n  Provider --\u003e Navbar\n  Provider --\u003e Hero\n  Provider --\u003e Footer\n  Provider --\u003e LangSwitcher\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n\n## Core Components\n- LanguageContext provider and hook:\n  - Defines the Language union and LanguageContextType interface.\n  - Initializes language state to Arabic.\n  - Exposes setLanguage to update language.\n  - Provides t(key) for localized string retrieval with fallback to the key itself.\n  - Computes isRTL based on current language.\n  - Exposes useLanguage hook with runtime guard against misuse outside the provider.\n\n- LanguageSwitcher component:\n  - Presents language options with flags and labels.\n  - Calls setLanguage when a language is selected.\n\n- App root:\n  - Wraps the app with LanguageProvider.\n  - Uses isRTL and language to set document direction and font class.\n\n- UI components consuming translations:\n  - Navbar, HeroSection, and Footer demonstrate t usage and conditional RTL behavior.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L41)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe language system follows a classic React context pattern: a provider holds state and exposes it to consumers. Consumers subscribe via a custom hook and receive language, translation function, and RTL flag.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant User as \"User\"\n  participant LangSwitcher as \"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"\n  participant Provider as \"LanguageProvider\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageContext.tsx\"\n  participant Consumer as \"UI Component\u003cbr/\u003e(e.g., Navbar.tsx)\"\n  participant App as \"App.tsx\"\n\n  User-\u003e\u003eLangSwitcher: Click language button\n  LangSwitcher-\u003e\u003eProvider: setLanguage(newLang)\n  Provider-\u003e\u003eProvider: Update state (language)\n  Provider--\u003e\u003eConsumer: Re-render with new {language, t, isRTL}\n  App-\u003e\u003eApp: Apply dir={isRTL ?

'rtl' : 'ltr'} to adapt layout direction.\n\n- HeroSection:\n  - Uses t for hero title, subtitle, tagline, date, day, and discover-more text.\n\n- Footer:\n  - Uses t for rights text and integrates language-aware subtitle and follow-us text.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L292)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\n- Provider-to-consumer dependency:\n  - All UI components depend on LanguageContext via useLanguage.\n  - LanguageSwitcher depends on useLanguage to update language.\n\n- Root-to-provider dependency:\n  - App.tsx depends on LanguageProvider to wrap the app.\n\n- Internal dependency within provider:\n  - t function depends on the translations object and current language.\n  - isRTL depends on current language.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph LR\n  App[\"App.tsx\"] --\u003e Provider[\"LanguageContext.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eLanguageProvider\"]\n  Provider --\u003e Navbar[\"Navbar.tsx\"]\n  Provider --\u003e Hero[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n  Provider --\u003e Footer[\"Footer.tsx\"]\n  Provider --\u003e LangSwitcher[\"LanguageSwitcher.tsx\"]\n  Provider --\u003e Translations[\"Translations object\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L268)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [Footer.tsx](file://src/components/Footer.tsx#L1-L117)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L41)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L12-L268)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Minimize re-renders:\n  - Keep the provider near the root to avoid unnecessary re-renders in deep subtrees.\n  - Avoid passing large objects through provider props; keep state minimal (language, t, isRTL).\n\n- Translation function stability:\n  - The t function is stable across renders because it is defined inside the provider and does not depend on props or external state changes.\n  - Consumers will re-render when language changes, but the function reference remains constant.\n\n- Conditional rendering and direction:\n  - Applying dir and font classes at the root reduces layout thrashing and avoids per-component direction checks.\n\n- Large translation objects:\n  - The translations object is static and does not grow with component mounts; it is safe to keep it in the provider.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- Context not available outside the provider:\n  - Symptom: Error indicating useLanguage must be used within a LanguageProvider.\n  - Cause: useLanguage was called without a LanguageProvider ancestor.\n  - Solution: Ensure the app is wrapped with LanguageProvider at the root level.\n\n- Missing translations:\n  - Symptom: Keys appear instead of localized strings.\n  - Cause: The key is not present in the translations object for the current language.\n  - Solution: Add the key to all languages or handle missing keys gracefully in components.\n\n- Mixed-direction text issues:\n  - Symptom: Text alignment anomalies in mixed-language content.\n  - Cause: Improper direction handling in components.\n  - Solution: Use isRTL consistently and apply dir attributes where needed.\n\n- Font selection not updating:\n  - Symptom: Typography does not switch between Arabic and non-Arabic fonts.\n  - Cause: Font class not applied conditionally based on language.\n  - Solution: Ensure the root applies the font class based on language.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L285-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L12-L31)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe LanguageContext implementation provides a clean, efficient foundation for multilingual support in the sc-dof platform. It initializes language to Arabic, exposes a stable translation function with fallback behavior, computes RTL support, and integrates seamlessly with UI components. Following the usage patterns shown here ensures consistent localization and responsive layout across languages while avoiding common pitfalls.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-8cdbec1e-b3ef-4eeb-ac21-e791046fcf68","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":28121,"completion_tokens":2843,"total_tokens":30964,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
