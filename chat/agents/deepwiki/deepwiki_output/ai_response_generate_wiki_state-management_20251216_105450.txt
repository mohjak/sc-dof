Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the state management system focused on the application's approach to managing global and local state. Explain how React Context API is used through the LanguageProvider to share language preferences across components. Detail the integration of React Query for server state management and data synchronization. Describe the custom hooks like use-mobile and use-toast that encapsulate reusable stateful logic. Illustrate how these state management solutions work together in components, such as how the mobile detection affects UI rendering. Include practical examples from the codebase showing state updates and re-renders. Address common state management issues like unnecessary re-renders and provide performance optimization strategies.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nState Management\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

This documentation provides a detailed analysis of how these state management solutions work together to create a responsive, localized, and efficient user experience. The system enables language preference sharing across components, manages UI state for mobile detection and toast notifications, and provides a foundation for potential server data synchronization through React Query.\n\n## Global State Management with React Context\nThe application uses React Context API to manage global state, primarily for language preferences and directionality. The LanguageProvider component wraps the entire application, making language state available to all components without prop drilling. This approach enables consistent language handling across the application and automatic UI adjustments based on the selected language. The context provides not only the current language but also a translation function and RTL (right-to-left) detection for Arabic language support.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[App Component] --\u003e B[QueryClientProvider]\n    B --\u003e C[TooltipProvider]\n    C --\u003e D[LanguageProvider]\n    D --\u003e E[AppContent]\n    E --\u003e F[All Application Components]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L33-L40)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L33-L40)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L269-L282)\n\n## Language Context Implementation\nThe LanguageContext provides a complete internationalization solution with support for Arabic, English, and Turkish languages. It maintains the current language state and provides a set of utilities including a translation function (t) and RTL detection. The context stores translations for all UI elements in a structured format, allowing components to access localized text through key-based lookups. When the language changes, all components that consume the context automatically re-render with the updated translations.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class LanguageContext {\n        +language: Language\n        +setLanguage(lang: Language): void\n        +t(key: string): string\n        +isRTL: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class LanguageProvider {\n        -language: Language\n        -setLanguage: (lang: Language) =\u003e void\n        +value: LanguageContextType\n    }\n    \n    class LanguageSwitcher {\n        -language: Language\n        -setLanguage: (lang: Language) =\u003e void\n        +render(): JSX.Element\n    }\n    \n    class Navbar {\n        -t: (key: string) =\u003e string\n        -isRTL: boolean\n        +render(): JSX.Element\n    }\n    \n    LanguageProvider --\u003e LanguageContext : \"provides\"\n    LanguageSwitcher --\u003e LanguageContext : \"consumes\"\n    Navbar --\u003e LanguageContext : \"consumes\"\n    HeroSection --\u003e LanguageContext : \"consumes\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L5-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n\n## Server State Management with React Query\nThe application integrates React Query for server state management, providing a robust solution for data fetching, caching, and synchronization. The QueryClient is instantiated at the application root and provided through QueryClientProvider, making it available to all components. This setup enables efficient data fetching with built-in caching, automatic refetching, and loading state management. Although specific query implementations are not visible in the current codebase, the infrastructure is in place to support server state management for features like event registration data or speaker information.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant App\n    participant QueryClientProvider\n    participant Component\n    participant API\n    \n    App-\u003e\u003eQueryClientProvider: Initialize QueryClient\n    QueryClientProvider-\u003e\u003eComponent: Provide queryClient\n    Component-\u003e\u003eAPI: query.fetchData()\n    API--\u003e\u003eComponent: Return data\n    Component-\u003e\u003eQueryClientProvider: Cache data\n    QueryClientProvider-\u003e\u003eComponent: Provide cached data\n    Component-\u003e\u003eUI: Render with data\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L4-L10)\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L42)\n\n## Custom Hooks for Reusable State Logic\nThe application implements several custom hooks to encapsulate reusable stateful logic. These hooks abstract complex state management patterns and provide clean APIs for components to consume. The useIsMobile hook detects screen size to enable responsive design, while the useToast hook manages toast notification state with an imperative API. These custom hooks follow React best practices by using useState, useEffect, and other built-in hooks to manage state and side effects.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class useIsMobile {\n        +MOBILE_BREAKPOINT: number\n        +isMobile: boolean\n        +return: boolean\n        +useEffect(): void\n    }\n    \n    class useToast {\n        +TOAST_LIMIT: number\n        +TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY: number\n        +toasts: ToasterToast[]\n        +toast(): Toast\n        +dismiss(): void\n        +reducer(): State\n    }\n    \n    class useLanguage {\n        +language: Language\n        +setLanguage(): void\n        +t(): string\n        +isRTL: boolean\n    }\n    \n    class Component {\n        +useState(): any\n        +useEffect(): void\n    }\n    \n    useIsMobile --\u003e Component : \"used by\"\n    useToast --\u003e Component : \"used by\"\n    useLanguage --\u003e Component : \"used by\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L285-L291)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n\n## State Management Integration in Components\nThe state management system is seamlessly integrated into various components throughout the application. The Navbar component uses the LanguageContext to display translated navigation items and handle RTL layout. The LanguageSwitcher component allows users to change the language preference, triggering re-renders across the application. The HeroSection component uses the translation function to display localized content. This integration demonstrates how global state, custom hooks, and component state work together to create a cohesive user experience.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[User Interaction] --\u003e B{Component Type}\n    B --\u003e C[LanguageSwitcher]\n    B --\u003e D[Navbar]\n    B --\u003e E[HeroSection]\n    B --\u003e F[RegistrationSection]\n    \n    C --\u003e G[setLanguage]\n    G --\u003e H[LanguageContext Update]\n    H --\u003e I[All Context Consumers]\n    I --\u003e J[Re-render with new language]\n    \n    D --\u003e K[useLanguage]\n    K --\u003e L[Get t() and isRTL]\n    L --\u003e M[Render Translated Nav]\n    \n    E --\u003e N[useLanguage]\n    N --\u003e O[Get t()]\n    O --\u003e P[Render Translated Hero]\n    \n    F --\u003e Q[useLanguage]\n    Q --\u003e R[Get language]\n    R --\u003e S[Render Language-specific Text]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [LanguageSwitcher.tsx](file://src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx#L1-L44)\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n## Performance Optimization and Best Practices\nThe application follows several performance optimization strategies in its state management implementation. The LanguageContext minimizes re-renders by providing stable function references and using memoization patterns. The useIsMobile hook efficiently handles window resize events with proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks. The toast system implements a queue with automatic dismissal to prevent UI clutter. These optimizations ensure that state changes are handled efficiently and that the application remains responsive even with frequent state updates.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L8-L16)\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L53-L69)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L272-L274)\n\n## Conclusion\nThe application's state management system effectively combines React Context API, React Query, and custom hooks to create a robust foundation for both client and server state management. The LanguageProvider enables seamless internationalization with support for multiple languages and RTL layout. Custom hooks like useIsMobile and useToast encapsulate reusable stateful logic, promoting code reuse and maintainability. The integration of React Query provides a scalable solution for server state management and data synchronization. Together, these state management solutions create a responsive, localized, and efficient user experience that can be easily extended with additional features and data sources.\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-e5359744-9eb5-4fdf-8d6c-b36bdb0b1db0","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":25994,"completion_tokens":2386,"total_tokens":28380,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
