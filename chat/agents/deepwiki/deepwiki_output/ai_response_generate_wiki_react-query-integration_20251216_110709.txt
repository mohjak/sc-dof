Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive content for the React Query integration focused on client-side state management and data synchronization. Explain how the QueryClient is instantiated and provided at the root level via QueryClientProvider in App.tsx. Describe the role of React Query in managing server state, caching, and background data fetching even though no explicit queries are currently implemented. Illustrate how this setup prepares the application for future data-fetching needs such as dynamic event data or registration forms. Include usage patterns for useQuery and useMutation hooks with practical examples relevant to the event platform. Address configuration options like cache time, stale time, and refetching strategies. Provide guidance on debugging with React Query Devtools and optimizing performance through query keys and prefetching. Discuss error handling, loading states, and how React Query integrates with the existing Context API for a cohesive state management strategy.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nReact Query Integration\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

It focuses on how the QueryClient is instantiated and provided at the root level via QueryClientProvider in App.tsx, and how this setup positions the app to handle server state, caching, and background data fetching. Even though explicit queries are not currently implemented, the integration prepares the application for future needs such as dynamic event data or registration workflows. The document also covers usage patterns for useQuery and useMutation hooks, configuration options (cache time, stale time, refetching strategies), debugging with React Query Devtools, performance optimization through query keys and prefetching, error handling, loading states, and how React Query complements the existing Context API for a cohesive state management strategy.\n\n## Project Structure\nReact Query is configured at the application root so that all components can benefit from centralized caching and background synchronization. Providers wrap the app in a specific order to ensure global availability of query state, language context, and UI utilities.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  Root[\"main.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eRender App\"] --\u003e App[\"App.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eQueryClientProvider + LanguageProvider + TooltipProvider\"]\n  App --\u003e Index[\"Index.tsx\u003cbr/\u003ePage container\"]\n  Index --\u003e Sections[\"Components\u003cbr/\u003eSections and UI\"]\n  App --\u003e Providers[\"Providers Order\u003cbr/\u003eQueryClientProvider → TooltipProvider → LanguageProvider\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n## Core Components\n- QueryClientProvider: Exposes the QueryClient to the entire component tree, enabling useQuery/useMutation hooks anywhere in the app.\n- App.tsx: Instantiates the QueryClient and wraps the application with providers to ensure global availability.\n- LanguageContext: Provides language and translation state; it coexists with React Query’s caching to manage UI-related state alongside server state.\n- RegistrationSection: Demonstrates a real-world scenario where external links and QR codes are used for registration; this is a good candidate for integrating React Query in the future (e.g., fetching registration status or form metadata).\n\nKey integration points:\n- The QueryClient is created at the root and passed to QueryClientProvider.\n- Providers are ordered to ensure that language and tooltips are available globally while query state is accessible everywhere.\n- Components like RegistrationSection rely on external resources; React Query can later be used to fetch and cache such data.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n## Architecture Overview\nThe application’s architecture centers around a root-level QueryClientProvider that enables React Query across the app. This setup allows components to leverage caching, background refetching, and optimistic updates without requiring explicit queries today. The Context API manages UI state (language and translations), while React Query manages server state and caching.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  subgraph \"Application Root\"\n    QCP[\"QueryClientProvider\u003cbr/\u003esrc/App.tsx\"]\n    TP[\"TooltipProvider\u003cbr/\u003esrc/App.tsx\"]\n    LP[\"LanguageProvider\u003cbr/\u003esrc/App.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Pages and Sections\"\n    IDX[\"Index.tsx\"]\n    HERO[\"HeroSection.tsx\"]\n    REG[\"RegistrationSection.tsx\"]\n  end\n\n  subgraph \"Data and Context\"\n    LCTX[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n    EDATA[\"eventData.ts\"]\n  end\n\n  QCP --\u003e IDX\n  QCP --\u003e HERO\n  QCP --\u003e REG\n  LP --\u003e IDX\n  LP --\u003e HERO\n  LP --\u003e REG\n  LCTX --\u003e HERO\n  LCTX --\u003e REG\n  EDATA --\u003e HERO\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### QueryClient Initialization and Provider Setup\n- The QueryClient is instantiated at the root and passed to QueryClientProvider.\n- Providers are ordered to ensure that TooltipProvider and LanguageProvider are available inside the QueryClientProvider.\n- This setup guarantees that all components can use React Query hooks and benefit from caching and background synchronization.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n  participant M as \"main.tsx\"\n  participant A as \"App.tsx\"\n  participant P as \"Providers\"\n  participant I as \"Index.tsx\"\n  participant S as \"Sections\"\n\n  M-\u003e\u003eA: Render App\n  A-\u003e\u003eP: Wrap with QueryClientProvider + TooltipProvider + LanguageProvider\n  P--\u003e\u003eI: Make query state available\n  I-\u003e\u003eS: Render page sections\n  S--\u003e\u003eS: Access language and UI utilities\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [main.tsx](file://src/main.tsx#L1-L6)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n### How React Query Prepares the App for Future Data Fetching\n- Even without explicit queries, the QueryClient is ready to cache server state and coordinate background refetching.\n- The app is structured to support dynamic event data and registration workflows:\n  - Dynamic event data: Use useQuery to fetch and cache event details, agenda, speakers, and venue information.\n  - Registration forms: Use useQuery to fetch form metadata and useMutation to submit registrations, with optimistic updates and error handling.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  Start([\"App Ready\"]) --\u003e NeedData{\"Need Dynamic Data?\"}\n  NeedData --\u003e|Yes| UseQuery[\"useQuery: fetch/cache data\"]\n  NeedData --\u003e|Yes| UseMutation[\"useMutation: submit data\"]\n  UseQuery --\u003e Cache[\"React Query Cache\"]\n  UseMutation --\u003e Optimistic[\"Optimistic Updates\"]\n  Optimistic --\u003e Refetch[\"Background Refetch\"]\n  Cache --\u003e UI[\"UI Renders with Cached Data\"]\n  Refetch --\u003e UI\n  UI --\u003e End([\"User Experience Improved\"])\n  NeedData --\u003e|No| End\n```\n\n[No sources needed since this diagram shows conceptual workflow, not actual code structure]\n\n### Practical Usage Patterns with useQuery and useMutation\n- useQuery pattern (conceptual):\n  - Define a query key that uniquely identifies the resource (e.g., event details).\n  - Configure cache time and stale time to balance freshness and performance.\n  - Handle loading and error states in components.\n  - Use enabled conditions to prevent unnecessary requests.\n- useMutation pattern (conceptual):\n  - Define mutation key aligned with the resource being updated.\n  - Use optimistic updates to improve perceived performance.\n  - Invalidate related queries after successful mutations to trigger refetch.\n  - Handle errors and surface user feedback.\n\nThese patterns align with the existing structure where components like RegistrationSection and HeroSection can later integrate with external APIs through React Query.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n- [HeroSection.tsx](file://src/components/HeroSection.tsx#L1-L99)\n\n### Configuration Options: Cache Time, Stale Time, and Refetching Strategies\n- Cache time: Controls how long cached data remains in memory before being garbage collected.\n- Stale time: Determines when data is considered stale and eligible for background refetch.\n- Refetching strategies: Configure automatic refetch on window focus, network reconnect, or periodic intervals.\n- These settings help balance responsiveness with data freshness and reduce unnecessary network requests.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n### Debugging with React Query Devtools\n- Install and mount React Query Devtools to inspect query keys, cache state, refetch reasons, and performance metrics.\n- Use the devtools to verify that queries are being cached and refetched as expected.\n- Monitor mutation lifecycles and invalidations to ensure data consistency.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n### Performance Optimization Through Query Keys and Prefetching\n- Use precise, hierarchical query keys to group related data and enable targeted invalidations.\n- Prefetch frequently accessed data during route transitions to reduce perceived latency.\n- Combine query keys with stale time and cache time to minimize redundant requests.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n### Error Handling and Loading States\n- useQuery exposes loading, error, and data states; components should render appropriate UI for each state.\n- useMutation exposes variables, isLoading, isError, and isSuccess; combine with notifications and retry logic.\n- Integrate with existing toast utilities to communicate outcomes to users.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [use-toast.ts](file://src/hooks/use-toast.ts#L1-L187)\n\n### Integration with Context API for Cohesive State Management\n- LanguageContext manages UI state (language, translations, RTL) and is provided alongside React Query.\n- Components can consume both query state and language state concurrently.\n- This dual-layer approach separates UI state (Context) from server state (React Query), keeping concerns distinct and maintainable.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Dependency Analysis\nReact Query is included as a dependency and is provided at the root. The app’s routing and component structure are compatible with React Query’s global availability.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TB\n  Pkg[\"package.json\u003cbr/\u003e@tanstack/react-query\"] --\u003e App[\"App.tsx\u003cbr/\u003eQueryClientProvider\"]\n  App --\u003e Components[\"Components\u003cbr/\u003euseQuery/useMutation\"]\n  App --\u003e Pages[\"Pages\u003cbr/\u003eIndex.tsx\"]\n  App --\u003e Context[\"LanguageContext.tsx\"]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [Index.tsx](file://src/pages/Index.tsx#L1-L32)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [package.json](file://package.json#L1-L85)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Performance Considerations\n- Choose appropriate cache and stale times to minimize network usage while keeping data fresh.\n- Use query keys that reflect resource identity and scope to avoid cache bloat.\n- Leverage background refetching and selective invalidation to keep data consistent without blocking UI.\n- Combine React Query with Context API to avoid redundant re-renders by separating concerns.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Troubleshooting Guide\n- If components do not receive query state, verify that QueryClientProvider is wrapping the app and that providers are ordered correctly.\n- If queries appear to run repeatedly, review query keys and refetch strategies to avoid unnecessary refetches.\n- If UI does not reflect recent changes after mutations, ensure that related queries are invalidated and refetched.\n- Use React Query Devtools to inspect query lifecycle and cache state.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n## Conclusion\nThe application is configured with a root-level QueryClientProvider, positioning the app to adopt React Query for server state management and data synchronization. While explicit queries are not yet implemented, the architecture supports future enhancements such as dynamic event data and registration workflows. By leveraging useQuery/useMutation, thoughtful configuration of cache and stale times, and complementary Context API usage, the app can achieve robust, performant, and user-friendly data handling.\n\n[No sources needed since this section summarizes without analyzing specific files]\n\n## Appendices\n\n### Appendix A: Example Scenarios for React Query Integration\n- Dynamic event data:\n  - Use useQuery to fetch event details, agenda, and speaker lists.\n  - Configure cache and stale times to balance freshness and performance.\n- Registration form:\n  - Use useQuery to fetch form metadata and submission status.\n  - Use useMutation to submit registrations with optimistic updates and error handling.\n  - Invalidate related queries after successful submissions to refresh cached data.\n\n[No sources needed since this section provides general guidance]\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-12e6cb73-cc9a-4e2b-a54e-605c8f23f662","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":34685,"completion_tokens":3114,"total_tokens":37799,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
