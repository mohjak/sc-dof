Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nDevelop detailed content for the customization guide focused on extending and modifying the sc-dof platform.

[RTL Compatibility and Best Practices](#rtl-compatibility-and-best-practices)\n\n## Theme Customization\n\nThe sc-dof platform uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with theme configuration centralized in `tailwind.config.ts`. The theme extends default Tailwind values with custom colors, fonts, and breakpoints that reflect Syrian cultural identity. The platform's visual design incorporates the Syrian flag colors (red, green, black) and gold accents, with special attention to Arabic typography through the Bahij Koufiya font.\n\nTo customize the theme, modify the `extend` property in the Tailwind configuration. The current configuration includes custom color definitions for `syrian` (red, green, black), `gold`, and `cream`, along with font family definitions for `koufiya` (used for Arabic) and `roboto` (used for English and Turkish). The theme also defines custom border radii and animations for accordions.\n\nWhen adding new colors, follow the existing pattern of using CSS variables defined in `src/index.css`. For example, to add a new \"sky\" color, first define the CSS variable in `index.css` and then reference it in `tailwind.config.ts` using the `hsl(var(--variable-name))` syntax. This approach ensures consistency between light and dark modes, as the CSS variables are defined for both themes.\n\nFor font customization, add new font families to the `fontFamily` object in the Tailwind configuration. Ensure that any new Arabic fonts support proper text rendering and are loaded in `src/index.css` using `@font-face` rules. The platform currently uses font swapping to ensure text remains visible during font loading.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [tailwind.config.ts](file://tailwind.config.ts#L1-L98)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n\n## Language Extension\n\nThe sc-dof platform supports multiple languages through a context-based internationalization system. The `LanguageContext` provides a `t` function for translation lookups and manages the current language state. Currently, the platform supports Arabic (`ar`), English (`en`), and Turkish (`tr`), with Arabic being the default language.\n\nTo add a new language, extend the `Language` type in `LanguageContext.tsx` with the appropriate language code, then add a new entry to the `translations` object. Each translation entry should follow the same key structure as existing languages, with keys organized by component and purpose (e.g., `nav.home`, `hero.title`). The translation system uses dot notation to organize keys hierarchically.\n\nComponents access translations through the `useLanguage` hook, which provides the current language, a function to change the language, the translation function `t`, and a boolean indicating whether the current language is right-to-left (RTL). The `LanguageSwitcher` component renders buttons for each available language, with visual feedback for the currently selected language.\n\nWhen adding a new language, ensure that all existing translation keys are provided with appropriate values. Missing translations will fall back to the key itself, which may not be user-friendly. The platform automatically applies RTL layout for Arabic content by setting the `dir` attribute on the root element, which affects text direction and component layout.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n\n## Event Content Updates\n\nEvent-specific content is managed in `eventData.ts`, which exports a configuration object containing all text and metadata for the Liberation Day celebration. This includes the event title, date, venue information, goals, agenda items, and organizer details. The data structure is designed to be easily modified without requiring code changes to components.\n\nTo update the event agenda, modify the `agenda` array in `eventData.ts`. Each agenda item includes a time label, title, description, and emoji icon. When adding new agenda items, follow the existing format and ensure that translations are updated in `LanguageContext.tsx` for all supported languages. The agenda component uses the translation function to display localized content, so new agenda items require corresponding translation keys.\n\nFor organizer information, the `organizers` array contains details about the hosting organizations. Each organizer includes a name, description, mission statement (for the primary organizer), and activities. When updating organizer information, provide content in all supported languages by adding corresponding entries in the translation system.\n\nThe event date and time are defined in multiple formats to support different display contexts. The `date` field uses ISO format for programmatic use, while `dateFormatted` provides a human-readable version. When updating the event date, ensure both fields are updated consistently.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [eventData.ts](file://src/data/eventData.ts#L1-L109)\n- [AgendaSection.tsx](file://src/components/AgendaSection.tsx#L1-L64)\n- [OrganizersSection.tsx](file://src/components/OrganizersSection.tsx#L1-L132)\n\n## RTL Compatibility and Best Practices\n\nThe sc-dof platform maintains RTL compatibility through a combination of CSS variables, Tailwind directives, and React context. The `LanguageContext` tracks whether the current language requires RTL layout, and this value is used to set the `dir` attribute on the root element in `App.tsx`. This approach ensures that all native HTML text direction features work correctly for Arabic content.\n\nWhen customizing the platform, follow these best practices to maintain RTL compatibility:\n\n1. Use semantic HTML and avoid absolute positioning when possible, as these are more likely to work correctly in both LTR and RTL contexts.\n2. Utilize Tailwind's built-in RTL support by using logical properties (e.g., `start` and `end` instead of `left` and `right`) when available.\n3. Test all visual changes in both Arabic and non-Arabic languages to ensure proper layout in both directions.\n4. When adding new icons or emoji, ensure they are culturally appropriate and do not carry unintended meanings in different contexts.\n5. Maintain consistent typography by using the appropriate font for each language (Koufiya for Arabic, Roboto for others).\n\nFor theme customization, ensure that any new colors have appropriate contrast ratios in both light and dark modes. The platform's color system is designed to work with both modes, so new colors should be defined as CSS variables with values for both light and dark contexts.\n\nWhen adding new content, provide translations for all supported languages to maintain a consistent user experience. The translation system is hierarchical, so new keys should follow the existing naming convention (e.g., `component.purpose`).\n\n**Section sources**\n- [App.tsx](file://src/App.tsx#L1-L43)\n- [LanguageContext.tsx](file://src/contexts/LanguageContext.tsx#L1-L292)\n- [index.css](file://src/index.css#L1-L249)\n\n\u003c/docs\u003e","response_meta":{"id":"chatcmpl-50ce4191-099a-4ff0-a402-17202c33f116","finish_reason":"stop","usage":{"prompt_tokens":29185,"completion_tokens":1580,"total_tokens":30765,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""}]
