Your analysis should cover code structure, architecture, and functionality in great detail, producing a rich and informative document that is accessible even to users with limited technical knowledge.\n\u003c/role\u003e\n\n\u003ctool_calling\u003e\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n1. ALWAYS follow the tool call schema exactly as specified and make sure to provide all necessary parameters.\n2. The conversation may reference tools that are no longer available. NEVER call tools that are not explicitly provided.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools.\n4.  Always look for opportunities to execute multiple tools in parallel. Before making any tool calls, plan ahead to identify which operations can be run simultaneously rather than sequentially.\n\u003c/tool_calling\u003e\n\n\u003cmaximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTION: For maximum efficiency, whenever you perform multiple independent operations, invoke all relevant tools simultaneously rather than sequentially. Prioritize calling tools in parallel whenever possible. For example, when reading 3 files, run 3 tool calls in parallel to read all 3 files into context at the same time. When running multiple read-only tools like `read_file`, `list_dir` or `search_codebase`, always run all the tools in parallel. Err on the side of maximizing parallel tool calls rather than running too many tools sequentially.\n\nWhen gathering information about a topic, plan your searches upfront in your thinking and then execute all tool calls together. For instance, all of these cases SHOULD use parallel tool calls:\n- Searching for different patterns (imports, usage, definitions) should happen in parallel\n- Multiple grep searches with different regex patterns should run simultaneously\n- Reading multiple files or searching different directories can be done all at once\n- Combining search_codebase with grep_code for comprehensive results\n- Any information gathering where you know upfront what you're looking for\nAnd you should use parallel tool calls in many more cases beyond those listed above.\n\nBefore making tool calls, briefly consider: What information do I need to fully answer this question? Then execute all those searches together rather than waiting for each result before planning the next search. Most of the time, parallel tool calls can be used rather than sequential. Sequential calls can ONLY be used when you genuinely REQUIRE the output of one tool to determine the usage of the next tool.\n\nDEFAULT TO PARALLEL: Unless you have a specific reason why operations MUST be sequential (output of A required for input of B), always execute multiple tools simultaneously. This is not just an optimization - it's the expected behavior. Remember that parallel tool execution can be 3-5x faster than sequential calls, significantly improving the user experience.\n\u003c/maximize_parallel_tool_calls\u003e\n\n\n\u003caction_directive\u003e\n1. Be proactive and decisive - if you have the tools to complete a task, proceed with execution rather than asking for confirmation.\n2. Use search_codebase, read_file, recommend_file and other tools as much as possible to obtain enough context information.\n3. Do not repeatedly use the same tool to query duplicate information; try to query valid information correctly in one attempt\n4. The relevant files of the specified file can be obtained through the view_dependencies parameter of the read_file tool.\n5. When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.\n6. If search_codebase returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.\n7. Searching multiple information using a search tool at one time is better than querying different information multiple times.\n8. The task must ultimately be completed without waiting for confirmation or executing in multiple phases.\n9. If there is a clear file path, use read_file to get the file content.\n10. If only know the exact file name, use search_file to get the file path.\n11. Any symbol lookups include class,method,definitions,implementation, use `search_symbol`.\n12. If clear information is lacking and fuzzy search is required (e.g., searching for code of a certain function), try to use search_codebase to find relevant files.\n\u003c/action_directive\u003e\n\n# ANALYSIS PROTOCOL\n\n## 1.

All content must be sourced directly from the repository files - never invent or fabricate information\n2. **Start with Referenced Files**: Begin every document with \"Referenced Files in This Document\" wrapped in `\u003ccite\u003e\u003c/cite\u003e` tags, listing ALL specific files that will be mentioned throughout the document\n3. **Section sources rule**: Only add \"Section sources\" when the section directly analyzes specific source files - do NOT add fake sources - Use file paths, not directory paths\n4. **Diagram sources rule**: Only add \"Diagram sources\" when the diagram directly visualizes specific source files or code structures - do NOT add sources for conceptual diagrams - Use file paths, not directory paths\n5. All file sources MUST use the `file://relativepath/to/file` format with specific line ranges when possible, where `relativepath/to/file` represents the relative file path with respect to the repository root directory\n6. If some files cannot be analyzed, ignore them\n7. Ensure explanations are accessible to users with limited technical knowledge\n8. **Every file in \"Referenced Files in This Document\" must be actually referenced somewhere in the document**\n9. Mermaid diagram do not allow any style colors to be output, only default colors are allowed\n10. Maintain consistency in source formatting throughout the document\n11. **Abstract sections (Introduction, Conclusion, Overview) typically do not need section sources unless they analyze specific files**\n12. **If you cannot find relevant source files for a section, omit \"Section sources\" completely**\n13. **If a diagram shows conceptual information without mapping to actual source files, omit \"Diagram sources\" completely**\n14. **Use specific file names (e.g., main.go, auth.go) rather than directory or conceptual descriptions**\n15. **Include specific line numbers when referencing code sections (e.g., #L15-L30)**\n16. Avoid providing specific code content and examples. Where possible, provide the code snippet path through source as an alternative.\n17. Be as detailed and complete as possible, don't ignore details\n18 .Don't stop if it's incomplete\n19. Validate all diagrams\n20. If the project size is large, you need to retrieve and analyze it first, and then output the full document\n21. Don't use list_dir repeatedly to obtain directory or file information that is already provided in the project structure.\n22. Don't stop to ask, you must complete the task once and for all\n23. Don't hold back. Give it your all.\n\n**IMPORTANT: You MUST respond in English(English) .All levels of headings must comply with the language requirements.**\nTitle Enforcement Rules for Language Conversion\nHeading Hierarchy Requirements:All heading levels starting with #, ##, ###, ** symbols\nLabel Structure Requirements:All descriptive labels within : structures (e.g., key names)\nConversion Mandate:Must be 100% converted to English(English)\n**No matter when, please use the corresponding English(English) when outputting the following strings, ignoring content requirements and sample requirements.**\nTable of Contents\nSection sources\nDiagram sources\n**Language Conversion Enforcement Rules**\nAll content, including headings, labels, citation notes, diagram annotations, and other elements, must be output entirely in English(English).\nSpecial attention: the titles of file references in markdown (the content within **), should be displayed in English(English).","response_meta":{"id":"","usage":{"prompt_tokens":0,"completion_tokens":0,"total_tokens":0,"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0},"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0}}},"reasoning_content_signature":""},{"role":"user","content":"The following is the core objective of the document:\n\u003cdocumentation_objective\u003e\nCreate comprehensive documentation for Dialog and Drawer components, which are used for registration forms and mobile navigation. Explain their underlying Radix UI primitives and how they handle focus trapping, keyboard navigation (Esc to close, Tab loop), and screen reader announcements. Document props like open, onOpenChange, and modal behavior. Differentiate use cases: Dialog for desktop modals, Drawer for swipeable mobile sheets. Provide integration examples from RegistrationSection and mobile menus. Detail RTL support for drawer positioning. Address common issues like scroll lock not working or backdrop clicks not closing the modal, with debugging steps. Include performance considerations around lazy mounting and animation smoothness.\n\u003c/documentation_objective\u003e\n\n\u003cdocument_title\u003e\nDialog \u0026 Drawer Components\n\u003c/document_title\u003e\n\n\u003cworkspace_path\u003e\n/home/mohjak/syrian-community/sc-dof\n\u003c/workspace_path\u003e\n\n\u003cproject_structure\u003e\n.\n├── public/\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── robots.txt\n│   └── site.webmanifest\n├── src/\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── ui/\n│   │   │   ├── accordion.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert-dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── alert.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── aspect-ratio.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── avatar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── badge.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── breadcrumb.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── button.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── calendar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── carousel.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── chart.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── checkbox.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── collapsible.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── command.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── context-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dialog.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── drawer.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── dropdown-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── form.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── hover-card.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input-otp.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── input.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── label.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── menubar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── navigation-menu.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── pagination.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── popover.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── progress.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── radio-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── resizable.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── scroll-area.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── select.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── separator.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sheet.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sidebar.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── skeleton.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── slider.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── sonner.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── switch.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── table.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tabs.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── textarea.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toast.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toaster.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle-group.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── toggle.tsx\n│   │   │   ├── tooltip.tsx\n│   │   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   │   ├── AgendaSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── CountdownTimer.tsx\n│   │   ├── DetailsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── Footer.tsx\n│   │   ├── GoalsSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── LanguageSwitcher.tsx\n│   │   ├── NavLink.tsx\n│   │   ├── Navbar.tsx\n│   │   ├── OrganizersSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── RegistrationSection.tsx\n│   │   ├── ScrollToTop.tsx\n│   │   ├── SpeakersSection.tsx\n│   │   └── WhySection.tsx\n│   ├── data/\n│   │   └── eventData.ts\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   ├── use-mobile.tsx\n│   │   └── use-toast.ts\n│   ├── lib/\n│   │   └── utils.ts\n│   ├── pages/\n│   │   ├── Index.tsx\n│   │   └── NotFound.tsx\n│   ├── App.tsx\n│   ├── index.css\n│   ├── main.tsx\n│   └── vite-env.d.ts\n├── .gitignore\n├── README.md\n├── components.json\n├── eslint.config.js\n├── index.html\n├── package-lock.json\n├── package.json\n├── postcss.config.js\n├── tailwind.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.app.json\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── tsconfig.node.json\n└── vite.config.ts\n\n\u003c/project_structure\u003e\n\nNow begin, analyze the codebase and generate documentation content as required.\n**IMPORTANT**:\n- You MUST respond in English(English).

These components serve distinct purposes: Dialog for desktop modals and Drawer for swipeable mobile sheets. Both components are built on top of accessible primitives and provide robust functionality for registration forms and mobile navigation. The documentation covers their underlying implementations, accessibility features, integration patterns, and troubleshooting guidance.\n\n## Core Components\n\nThe Dialog and Drawer components are fundamental UI elements in the application, designed to handle different interaction patterns based on device type and user context. The Dialog component is implemented using Radix UI's Dialog primitive, while the Drawer component leverages the Vaul library to provide native-like swipeable sheets on mobile devices.\n\n**Section sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n- [drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L1-L88)\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe architecture of the Dialog and Drawer components follows a consistent pattern of wrapping accessible primitives with custom styling and behavior enhancements. Both components provide a set of sub-components that follow a similar naming convention and structural pattern.\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[Dialog \u0026 Drawer Components] --\u003e B[Base Primitives]\n    B --\u003e C[Radix UI Dialog]\n    B --\u003e D[Vaul Drawer]\n    A --\u003e E[Wrapper Components]\n    E --\u003e F[Dialog.tsx]\n    E --\u003e G[Drawer.tsx]\n    A --\u003e H[Sub-components]\n    H --\u003e I[Trigger, Content, Overlay]\n    H --\u003e J[Header, Footer, Title]\n    F --\u003e K[Styling \u0026 Animation]\n    G --\u003e L[Swipe Gestures \u0026 Positioning]\n    K --\u003e M[Tailwind CSS]\n    L --\u003e N[Mobile-First Design]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n- [drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L1-L88)\n\n## Detailed Component Analysis\n\n### Dialog Component Analysis\nThe Dialog component is built on Radix UI's Dialog primitive, providing a fully accessible modal experience for desktop users. It handles focus trapping, keyboard navigation, and screen reader announcements through the underlying Radix implementation.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Dialog {\n        +Root: DialogPrimitive.Root\n        +Trigger: DialogPrimitive.Trigger\n        +Portal: DialogPrimitive.Portal\n        +Overlay: DialogPrimitive.Overlay\n        +Content: DialogPrimitive.Content\n        +Close: DialogPrimitive.Close\n    }\n    \n    class DialogSubComponents {\n        +Header: HTMLDivElement\n        +Footer: HTMLDivElement\n        +Title: DialogPrimitive.Title\n        +Description: DialogPrimitive.Description\n    }\n    \n    Dialog --\u003e DialogSubComponents : \"composes\"\n    Dialog --\u003e \"fixed inset-0 z-50\" : \"positions\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L7-L95)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L1-L96)\n\n### Drawer Component Analysis\nThe Drawer component is implemented using the Vaul library, which provides swipeable sheet functionality optimized for mobile devices. It's specifically designed for touch interactions and provides a native app-like experience for mobile navigation.\n\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Drawer {\n        +Root: DrawerPrimitive.Root\n        +Trigger: DrawerPrimitive.Trigger\n        +Portal: DrawerPrimitive.Portal\n        +Overlay: DrawerPrimitive.Overlay\n        +Content: DrawerPrimitive.Content\n        +Close: DrawerPrimitive.Close\n    }\n    \n    class DrawerSubComponents {\n        +Header: HTMLDivElement\n        +Footer: HTMLDivElement\n        +Title: DrawerPrimitive.Title\n        +Description: DrawerPrimitive.Description\n    }\n    \n    Drawer --\u003e DrawerSubComponents : \"composes\"\n    Drawer --\u003e \"fixed inset-x-0 bottom-0\" : \"positions\"\n    Drawer --\u003e \"h-2 w-[100px]\" : \"handle\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L6-L87)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L1-L88)\n\n### Responsive Behavior Analysis\nThe application implements a responsive design pattern that uses different components based on device type. The sidebar component demonstrates this pattern by using Sheet for mobile devices and a traditional sidebar for desktop.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    Start([Application Load]) --\u003e CheckMobile[\"useIsMobile() Hook\"]\n    CheckMobile --\u003e|Mobile| UseDrawer[\"Render Sheet Component\"]\n    CheckMobile --\u003e|Desktop| UseSidebar[\"Render Sidebar Component\"]\n    UseDrawer --\u003e ConfigureSheet[\"Set data-mobile=true\"]\n    UseSidebar --\u003e ConfigureSidebar[\"Set data-desktop=true\"]\n    ConfigureSheet --\u003e PositionBottom[\"Position at bottom\"]\n    ConfigureSidebar --\u003e PositionLeftRight[\"Position left/right\"]\n    PositionBottom --\u003e SwipeGestures[\"Enable swipe gestures\"]\n    PositionLeftRight --\u003e ClickAway[\"Enable click-away close\"]\n    \n    classDef mobile fill:#FFE4B5,stroke:#333;\n    classDef desktop fill:#E6E6FA,stroke:#333;\n    class UseDrawer,PositionBottom,SwipeGestures mobile;\n    class UseSidebar,PositionLeftRight,ClickAway desktop;\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx#L153-L171)\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L5-L19)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [sidebar.tsx](file://src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx#L150-L175)\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n\n## Integration Examples\n\n### Registration Form Integration\nThe Dialog component is used for registration forms, providing a focused experience for users completing the registration process. The component hierarchy follows a standard pattern with header, content, and footer sections.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    DialogRoot[Dialog Root] --\u003e DialogTrigger[Dialog Trigger]\n    DialogRoot --\u003e DialogPortal[Dialog Portal]\n    DialogPortal --\u003e DialogOverlay[Dialog Overlay]\n    DialogPortal --\u003e DialogContent[Dialog Content]\n    DialogContent --\u003e DialogHeader[Dialog Header]\n    DialogHeader --\u003e DialogTitle[Dialog Title]\n    DialogContent --\u003e FormContent[Form Elements]\n    DialogContent --\u003e DialogFooter[Dialog Footer]\n    DialogFooter --\u003e CancelButton[Cancel Button]\n    DialogFooter --\u003e SubmitButton[Submit Button]\n    DialogContent --\u003e CloseButton[Dialog Close]\n    \n    style DialogRoot fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,color:white\n    style DialogTrigger fill:#2196F3,stroke:#333,color:white\n    style DialogPortal fill:#9C27B0,stroke:#333,color:white\n    style DialogOverlay fill:#607D8B,stroke:#333,color:white\n    style DialogContent fill:#FF9800,stroke:#333,color:white\n    style DialogHeader fill:#795548,stroke:#333,color:white\n    style DialogFooter fill:#795548,stroke:#333,color:white\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L7-L95)\n- [RegistrationSection.tsx](file://src/components/RegistrationSection.tsx#L1-L105)\n\n### Mobile Navigation Integration\nThe mobile navigation system uses a conditional rendering approach based on screen size, switching between a traditional navbar for desktop and a drawer-like pattern for mobile devices.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User as \"User\"\n    participant Navbar as \"Navbar Component\"\n    participant Hook as \"useIsMobile Hook\"\n    participant State as \"isMobileMenuOpen State\"\n    \n    User-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Loads page\n    Navbar-\u003e\u003eHook: Calls useIsMobile()\n    Hook-\u003e\u003eHook: Checks window.matchMedia\n    Hook--\u003e\u003eNavbar: Returns isMobile boolean\n    Navbar-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Renders appropriate navigation\n    User-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Clicks menu button (mobile)\n    Navbar-\u003e\u003eState: Toggles isMobileMenuOpen\n    State--\u003e\u003eNavbar: State updated\n    Navbar-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Shows/hides mobile menu\n    User-\u003e\u003eNavbar: Clicks navigation link\n    Navbar-\u003e\u003eNavbar: scrollToSection()\n    Navbar-\u003e\u003eState: Sets isMobileMenuOpen to false\n    State--\u003e\u003eNavbar: Menu closes\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n- [use-mobile.tsx](file://src/hooks/use-mobile.tsx#L1-L20)\n\n**Section sources**\n- [Navbar.tsx](file://src/components/Navbar.tsx#L1-L123)\n\n## Accessibility and Interaction Patterns\n\n### Focus Management\nBoth Dialog and Drawer components implement proper focus trapping to ensure accessibility. When opened, focus is moved to the first focusable element within the component and trapped within it until closed.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    A[Initial Focus] --\u003e B[Dialog/Drawer Opens]\n    B --\u003e C[Focus Moved to First Focusable Element]\n    C --\u003e D[Tab Navigation Trapped Within Component]\n    D --\u003e E[Shift+Tab on First Element -\u003e Last Element]\n    D --\u003e F[Tab on Last Element -\u003e First Element]\n    E --\u003e D\n    F --\u003e D\n    D --\u003e G[Esc Key Closes Component]\n    G --\u003e H[Focus Returns to Trigger Element]\n    H --\u003e I[Normal Page Navigation]\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L30-L52)\n- [drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L25-L43)\n\n### Keyboard Navigation\nThe components support standard keyboard interactions expected by users, including Esc to close and Tab to navigate through focusable elements.\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --\u003e Closed\n    Closed --\u003e Opening: Trigger Clicked\n    Opening --\u003e Open: Animation Complete\n    Open --\u003e Closing: Esc Key Pressed\n    Open --\u003e Closing: Click Outside\n    Open --\u003e Closing: Close Button Clicked\n    Closing --\u003e Closed: Animation Complete\n    \n    note right of Open\n      Tab: cycles through focusable elements\n      Shift+Tab: reverse cycle\n      Esc: closes dialog/drawer\n    end note\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L15-L28)\n- [drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L17-L24)\n\n### Screen Reader Announcements\nThe components use appropriate ARIA attributes to ensure screen reader users are properly informed about the state and purpose of the dialogs and drawers.\n\n```mermaid\nerDiagram\n  DIALOG_COMPONENT {\n    string role \"dialog\"\n    string aria-labelledby \"DialogTitle ID\"\n    string aria-describedby \"DialogDescription ID\"\n    string aria-modal \"true\"\n  }\n  \n  DRAWER_COMPONENT {\n    string role \"dialog\"\n    string aria-labelledby \"DrawerTitle ID\"\n    string aria-describedby \"DrawerDescription ID\"\n    string aria-modal \"true\"\n  }\n  \n  TITLE_COMPONENT {\n    string id \"Referenced by aria-labelledby\"\n    string text \"Describes dialog purpose\"\n  }\n  \n  DESCRIPTION_COMPONENT {\n    string id \"Referenced by aria-describedby\"\n    string text \"Additional context/instructions\"\n  }\n  \n  DIALOG_COMPONENT ||--o{ TITLE_COMPONENT : \"has\"\n  DIALOG_COMPONENT ||--o{ DESCRIPTION_COMPONENT : \"has\"\n  DRAWER_COMPONENT ||--o{ TITLE_COMPONENT : \"has\"\n  DRAWER_COMPONENT ||--o{ DESCRIPTION_COMPONENT : \"has\"\n```\n\n**Diagram sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L64-L82)\n- [drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L56-L74)\n\n## Common Issues and Debugging\n\n### Scroll Lock Issues\nA common issue with modal components is scroll lock not working properly, allowing the background page to scroll when the dialog or drawer is open.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    Issue[Scroll Lock Not Working] --\u003e Check1{Is body.style.overflow\u003cbr\u003ebeing set to 'hidden'?}\n    Check1 --\u003e|No| Fix1[Add overflow-hidden to body]\n    Check1 --\u003e|Yes| Check2{Is original overflow\u003cbr\u003estate

[drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L17-L24)\n\n### Backdrop Click Issues\nAnother common issue is the backdrop click not closing the modal as expected, often due to event propagation problems.\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant User as \"User\"\n    participant Overlay as \"Overlay Element\"\n    participant Handler as \"onOpenChange Handler\"\n    participant State as \"open State\"\n    \n    User-\u003e\u003eOverlay: Clicks on overlay\n    Overlay-\u003e\u003eHandler: Triggers onOpenChange(false)\n    alt Handler Exists\n        Handler-\u003e\u003eState:

performance, especially with complex content, consider lazy mounting the dialog content to avoid rendering expensive components when the dialog is closed.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Dialog Closed] --\u003e B{Content Mounted?}\n    B --\u003e|No| C[Only render trigger and minimal DOM]\n    B --\u003e|Yes| D[Full component tree rendered]\n    C --\u003e E[User Opens Dialog]\n    E

end note\n```\n\n**Section sources**\n- [dialog.tsx](file://src/components/ui/dialog.tsx#L34-L51)\n- [drawer.tsx](file://src/components/ui/drawer.tsx#L29-L42)\n\n### Animation Smoothness\nEnsuring smooth animations is critical for user experience, particularly on mobile devices with limited processing power.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    A[Animation Performance] --\u003e B[Use CSS Transforms]\n    A --\u003e C[Use Will-Change Property]\n    A --\u003e D[Avoid Layout Thrashing]\n    A --\u003e E[Use RequestAnimationFrame]\n    A --\u003e F[Minimize Repaints]\n    \n    B
